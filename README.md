## OA Complexity Analysis


Inside the OAComplexity folder, the files found in the "texts" folder contain HTML from the main content pane of several websites. 

The code for the analysis of the texts is included in the Jupyter Notebook file "OAComplexity.ipynb". The code and output can be viewed in GitHub or run on your own machine after cloning the repository.

The raw numbers for our analysis are available in the spreadsheet titled "analysis_numbers.csv". There is also an Excel .xlsx file with the below information included as comments, and the publisher names in a different order to match other data collected for this project.

Two spreadsheets containing data for our qualitative analyses of Open Access definitions, choice language, and costs of Open Access publishing are included on the spreadsheets in the "qualitative analysis" folder. 

Please see the README file in this folder for more information.


## Patchy Endorsements Data

This folder contains spreadsheets containing the sources and analyses. Please see the README file in this folder for more details.

## TA Folder

This folder contains preliminary analyses for an upcoming project.
