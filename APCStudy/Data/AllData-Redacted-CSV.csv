So having the imprimatur of Cell or Nature in the journal title gives the allure of significance or importance. This is corrupting.

I am conflicted about my participation in open source publishing. Our article was originally submitted to [SUBSCRIPTION JOURNAL NAME]. We were referred to [OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL NAME] because they were just beginning the journal - that is why they waived the fee. Initial publications were promised a waived fee,  and so my  co-authors and I benefited from that timing. I just think it is inherently unfair that the public doesn't have open access to ALL published materials, especially when the opportunity to pay for publishing is not equally distributed among faculty. We need a better system! As you can see by my answers above, I object to the fees on principle, not because of the cost. Why should I benefit from paying a fee that others' can't afford?

You have to publish to advance, but if you run out of money you won't be able to continue your research, and you won't advance. For the particular journal article that this survey referenced, the publisher offered to waive the fee if we submitted our work to that particular journal. This was the determining factor for me. If I hadn't had to choose between one journal that didn't charge a fee and a handful of others that would charge $3,000+ (!), I probably would have submitted to one of the other journals.

We researchers pay to do the research. We pay to publish the research. We pay more to publish the research open access. And then we pay to access that published content. The whole system is a cash cow, and we pay and pay and pay. And worse, it's literally a requirement for our academic success. And that is before you investigate equity concerns...",Thank you for doing this research!

The paper was also short. Subscription based journals have given up (mostly) accepting short articles because they are a loser in the impact factor game. The only option for such a paper is open access. But my colleague had no money. We got the fee waived because we submitted to a journal that allows me a free submission as an editor. Without that, never would have been published.  ","I think open access tho well intentioned is a disaster. Authors should not be in the position of pay to play. The Library of Congress needs to publish scientific papers at cost, with the funds taken from an agency wide tax. For profit scientific publishers need to be put out of business. "

There is no space in grants to geographers to pay these types of fees.  I am lucky that UMass returns some overhead and that I have been hoarding it for 10+ years.  That source is depleting fast.,I would estimate that I'm paying $10-15k per year in publication fees because so many journals in my field have switched to open access and I want to make sure students are publishing in places that keep them competitive for future research careers.  UMass right now will partially subsidize one of those publications (but I need help with 4-5 pubs per year).  It is completely unsustainable and I have no idea how I will continue to pay for publications.
