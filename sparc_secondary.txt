We engage and invest in research in order to accelerate the pace 
of scienti c discovery, encourage innovation, enrich education, 
and stimulate the economy — to improve the public good. 
Communication o the results o research an essential component 
o the research process; research can only advance by sharing 
the results, and the value of an investment in research is only 
maximized through wide use of its results. 
Yet, too o en, because of cost barriers or use restrictions, research 
results are not available to the full community of potential 
users. The Internet gives us the opportunity to bring this crucial 
information to a worldwide audience at virtually no marginal 
cost, and allows us to use it in new, innovative ways. This has 
resulted in a call for a new framework to allow research results to 
be more easily accessed and used — the call for Open Access. 
Over the past decade, Open Access h become central to 
advancing the interests o researchers, scholars, students, business , 
and the public — well librarians. Increasingly, institutions 
that support research — from public and private research funders 
to higher education institutions — are implementing policies 
that require researchers to make articles that report on research 
generated from their funding openly accessible to and fully 
useable by the public. 
Open Access is the 
free, immediate, online 
availability of research 
articles, coupled with 
the rights to use these 
articl fully in the digital 
environment. 
81,780 articles in 2012 
were published in Open Access journals [1]

.................................................... 
SPARC considers the terms outlined by the Creative Commons 
Attribution-Only license (CC-BY) to be the standard terms for 
Open Access. Four primary mechanisms can be used to enable 
Open Access: 
.... ............................................ 
.... ........................................ 
.... ................................................................ 
.... ............................................................................................................ 
............................................ Authors can choose to publish their 
research articles in a growing number of journals that meet 
the full definition of Open Access. Articles are free to all 
interested readers, and the publisher places no financial or 
copyright barriers between the readers and the article. Open 
Access publishing is the fastest growing segment of the scholarly 
publishing market, and journal options are now available for 
nearly every area of research. 
........................................ Authors can choose to deposit their research 
articles in digital archives (often called Digital Repositories or 
Institutional Repositories) which conform to the standards of 
the Open Archives Initiative (OAI), and enable readers to freely 
access and fully reuse the article text. This allows any author 
to make their work available under Open Access conditions 
regardless of the journal out the article is published in. 
................................................................ As the author of a research 
paper, you have the ability to ensure that your article can be 
accessed and used by the widest possible audience. Tools such 
as Addenda to traditional Copyright Transfer Forms are readily 
available, proven resources that can help you understand open 
licenses and publish your articles under full Open Access 
conditions. 
............................................................................................................ 
Institutions that support research, from public and private 
research funders to higher education institutions, can 
implement effective policies that that support making Open 
Access to scholarly research articles the default mode for their 
researchers. 
.................................................. 
.............. 
.............................. Engage your campus 
community on the topic of Open Access. 
In conversations with faculty and students, 
explain how Open Access can raise the 
visibility and impact of their of research. 
Encourage authors to publish their work in 
Open Access journal, and to place their work 
your campus institutional repository. 
............................ Choose Open Access 
outlets to publish your own work whenever 
possible. 
.............................................. During 
International Open Access Week or any 
other time of year, events help identify and 
educate colleagues, identify champions on 
campus and dispel common misconceptions 
........................................................................ More 
than 300 institutions around the world 
now have institutional open access policies. 
SPARC has resources to help you build a 
successful on-campus campaign and can 
connect you with colleagues who have passed 
policies themselves through the Coalition of 
Open Access Policy Institutions (COAPI). 
...................................................................... The 
library community and SPARC have led 
the charge in working with policymakers to 
ensure that the results of publicly funded 
research are made freely available. Use 
SPARC’s legislative advocacy platform 
to contact your elected representatives in 
Congress and in your state.
