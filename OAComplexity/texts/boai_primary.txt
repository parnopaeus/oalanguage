<h3><strong>Prologue:

The Budapest Open Access Initiative after 10 years</strong></h3>

<p>Ten

years ago the Budapest Open Access Initiative launched a worldwide campaign for

open access (OA) to all new peer-reviewed research. It didn’t invent the idea

of OA. On the contrary, it deliberately drew together existing projects to

explore how they might “work together to achieve broader, deeper, and faster

success.” But the BOAI was the first initiative to use the term “open access”

for this purpose, the first to articulate a public definition, the first to

propose complementary strategies for realizing OA, the first to generalize the

call for OA to all disciplines and countries, and the first to be accompanied

by significant funding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today

we’re no longer at the beginning of this worldwide campaign, and not yet at the

end. We’re solidly in the middle, and draw upon a decade of experience in order

to make new recommendations for the next ten years.</p>

<p>We

reaffirm the BOAI “statement of principle,...statement of strategy,

and...statement of commitment.” We reaffirm the aspiration to achieve this

“unprecedented public good” and to “accelerate research, enrich education,

share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make

this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting

humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”</p>

<p>We

reaffirm our confidence that “the goal is attainable and not merely preferable

or utopian.” Nothing from the last ten years has made the goal less attainable.

On the contrary, OA is well-established and growing in every field. We have

more than a decade’s worth of practical wisdom on how to implement OA. The

technical, economic, and legal feasibility of OA are well-tested and

well-documented.</p>

<p>Nothing

in the last ten years makes OA less necessary or less opportune. On the

contrary, it remains the case that “scientists and scholars...publish the

fruits of their research in scholarly journals without payment” and “without

expectation of payment.” In addition, scholars typically participate in peer

review as referees and editors without expectation of payment. Yet more often

than not, access barriers to peer-reviewed research literature remain firmly in

place, for the benefit of intermediaries rather than authors, referees, or

editors, and at the expense of research, researchers, and research

institutions.</p>

<p>Finally,

nothing from the last ten years suggests that the goal is less valuable or

worth attaining. On the contrary, the imperative to make knowledge available to

everyone who can make use of it, apply it, or build on it is more pressing than

ever.</p>

<p>We

reaffirm the two primary strategies put forward in the BOAI: OA through

repositories (also called “green OA”) and OA through journals (also called

“gold OA”). Ten years of experience lead us to reaffirm that green and gold OA

“are not only direct and effective means to this end, they are within the reach

of scholars themselves, immediately, and need not wait on changes brought about

by markets or legislation.”</p>

<p>Ten

years of experience lead us to reaffirm the definition of OA introduced in the

original BOAI:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By “open access” to [peer-reviewed

research literature], we mean its free availability on the public internet,

permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link

to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data

to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial,

legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access

to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution,

and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors

control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly

acknowledged and cited.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The

problems that previously held up the adoption and implementation of OA are

solved, and the solutions are spreading. But until OA spreads further, the

problems for which OA is a solution will remain largely unsolved. In this

statement, we reaffirm the ends and means of the original BOAI, and recommit

ourselves to make progress. But in addition, we specifically set the new goal

that within the next ten years, OA will become the default method for

distributing new peer-reviewed research in every field and country.</p>

<h2><strong>Recommendations for the next 10 years</strong></h2>

<p><strong>1. On policy</strong></p>

<p>1.1. Every institution of higher education should have a policy

assuring that peer-reviewed versions of all future scholarly articles by

faculty members are deposited in the institution’s designated repository. (See

recommendation 3.1 on institutional repositories.)</p>

<ul><li>Deposits should be made as

early as possible, ideally at the time of acceptance, and no later than the

date of formal publication.<br /><br /></li><li>University policies should

respect faculty freedom to submit new work to the journals of their choice.<br /><br /></li><li>University policies should

encourage but not require publication in OA journals, and should help faculty

understand the difference between depositing in an OA repository and publishing

in an OA journal.<br /><br /></li><li>When possible, university

policies should be adopted by faculty vote, should require immediate OA, and

should welcome repository deposits even when not required (e.g. datasets,

conference presentations, books or book chapters, work published before the

policy's adoption, and so on).<br /><br /></li><li>When publishers will not

allow OA on the university’s preferred terms, we recommend either of two

courses. The policy may require dark or non-OA deposit in the institutional

repository until permission for OA can be obtained. Or the policy may grant the

institution a nonexclusive right to make future faculty research articles OA

through the institutional repository (with or without the option for faculty to

waive this grant of rights for any given publication).<br /></li></ul>

<p>1.2. Every institution of higher education offering advanced

degrees should have a policy assuring that future theses and dissertations are

deposited upon acceptance in the institution's OA repository. At the request of

students who want to publish their work, or seek a patent on a patentable

discovery, policies should grant reasonable delays rather than permanent

exemptions.</p>

<p>1.3. Every research funding agency, public or private, should

have a policy assuring that peer-reviewed versions of all future scholarly

articles reporting funded research are deposited in a suitable repository and

made OA as soon as practicable.</p>

<ul><li>Deposits should be made as

early as possible, ideally at the time of acceptance, and no later than the

date of formal publication.<br /><br /></li><li>When publishers will not

allow OA on the funder’s terms, funder policies should require grantees to seek

another publisher.<br /><br /></li><li>If funder policies allow

embargoes before new work becomes OA, the embargoes should not exceed six

months. Policies should allow no embargoes at all for uncopyrightable work.<br /><br /></li><li>Funders should treat

publication costs as research costs, and should help grantees pay reasonable

publication fees at fee-based OA journals.<br /><br /></li><li>When possible, funder

policies should require libre OA, preferably under a CC-BY license or

equivalent.<br /><br /></li><li>A repository is suitable for

this purpose when it provides OA, supports interoperability with other

repositories, and take steps toward long-term preservation. The funder’s choice

should be determined by ongoing research into questions such as which choice

best fosters the deposit of covered articles, the utility of deposits, the

convenience of funders and authors, and incentives for the further growth of

OA.<br /></li></ul>

<p>1.4. All university and funder OA policies should require

deposit in a suitable OA repository between the date of acceptance and the date

of publication. The metadata should be deposited as soon as it is available and

should be OA from the moment of deposit. The full-text should be made OA as

soon as the repository has permission to make it OA.</p>

<p>1.5. We discourage the use of journal impact factors as

surrogates for the quality of journals, articles, or authors. We encourage the

development of alternative metrics for impact and quality which are less

simplistic, more reliable, and entirely open for use and reuse.</p>

<ul><li>Insofar as universities, funding agencies, and research

assessment programs need to measure the impact of individual articles, they

should use article-level metrics, not journal-level metrics.<br /><br /></li><li>We encourage research on the accuracy of the new metrics. As the

research shows them to be useful and trustworthy, we encourage their use by

universities (when evaluating faculty for promotion and tenure), funding

agencies (when evaluating applicants for funding), research assessment programs

(when assessing research impact), and publishers (when promoting their

publications).<br /><br /></li><li>We encourage the development of materials to explain how journal

impact factors have been misused, and how alternative metrics can better serve

the purposes for which most institutions have previously used impact factors.<br /><br /></li><li>As impact metrics improve, we encourage further study into the

question whether OA and OA policies increase research impact.</li></ul>

<p>1.6. Universities with institutional repositories should require

deposit in the repository for all research articles to be considered for

promotion, tenure, or other forms of internal assessment and review.</p>

<ul><li>Similarly, governments performing research assessment should

require deposit in OA repositories for all research articles to be reviewed for

national assessment purposes.<br /><br /></li><li>Neither policy should be construed to limit the review of other

sorts of evidence, or to alter the standards of review.</li></ul>

<p>1.7.

Publishers who do not provide OA should at least permit it through their formal

publishing agreements.</p>

<ul><li>Publishers

should refrain from lobbying against governments acting in the public interest,

and refrain from lobbying against research institutions acting in the interests

of researchers and research. Publishers should disavow lobbying campaigns

carried out in their name by their professional or trade associations against

the public interest and the interests of researchers and research.<br /><br /></li><li>The

minority of subscription-based publishers who do not yet allow author-initiated

green OA, without payment or embargo, should adopt the majority position.<br /><br /></li><li>We

remind researchers that they need not work as authors, editors, or referees for

publishers who act against their interests.</li></ul>

<p><strong>2. On licensing and reuse</strong></p>

<p>2.1. We recommend CC-BY or an equivalent license as the optimal

license for the publication, distribution, use, and reuse of scholarly work.</p>

<ul><li>OA repositories typically depend on permissions from others,

such as authors or publishers, and are rarely in a position to require open

licenses. However, policy makers in a position to direct deposits into

repositories should require open licenses, preferably CC-BY, when they can.<br /><br /></li><li>OA journals are always in a position to require open licenses,

yet most of them do not yet take advantage of the opportunity. We recommend

CC-BY for all OA journals.<br /><br /></li><li>In developing strategy and setting priorities, we recognize that

gratis access is better than priced access, libre access is better than gratis

access, and libre under CC-BY or the equivalent is better than libre under more

restrictive open licenses. We should achieve what we can when we can. We should

not delay achieving gratis in order to achieve libre, and we should not stop

with gratis when we can achieve libre.</li></ul>

<p><strong>3. On infrastructure and sustainability</strong></p>

<p>3.1. Every institution of higher education should have an OA

repository, participate in a consortium with a consortial OA repository, or

arrange to outsource OA repository services.</p>

<p>3.2. Every publishing scholar in every field and country,

including those not affiliated with institutions of higher education, should

have deposit rights in an OA repository.</p>

<ul><li>This will require more institutional repositories or more

disciplinary repositories, or both. It may also require, at least in the short

term, more universal repositories or repositories of last resort for scholars

who don’t have an OA repository in their institution or field. The interface

text in these universal repositories should be available in several languages.</li></ul>

<p>3.3. OA repositories should acquire the means to harvest from

and re-deposit to other OA repositories.</p>

<ul><li>Researchers who have reason to deposit into more than one

repository should only have to deposit once. When possible, institutional

repositories should offer to re-deposit articles in disciplinary repositories

requested by authors (e.g. arXiv, PubMed Central, SSRN), and should harvest or

download copies of faculty publications deposited in disciplinary repositories.</li></ul>

<p>3.4. OA repositories should make download, usage, and citation

data available to their authors, and make these data available to the tools

computing alternative impact metrics. Journal publishers should do the same,

whether or not their journals are OA.</p>

<ul><li>Repositories should share these data with one another in

standard formats, making it possible (for example) for authors to learn the total

downloads for an article on deposit in multiple repositories. No author and no

repository should have interest in blocking re-deposit in an additional

repository simply to preserve an accurate measure of traffic.</li></ul>

<p>3.5. Universities and funding agencies should help authors pay

reasonable publication fees at fee-based OA journals, and find comparable ways

to support or subsidize no-fee OA journals.</p>

<ul><li>In both cases, they should require libre OA under open licenses,

preferably CC-BY licenses or the equivalent, as a condition of their financial

support.<br /><br /></li><li>Supporting peer-reviewed OA journals in these ways should be a

top priority for any money saved from the cancellation or conversion of

subscription journals.<br /><br /></li><li>Supporting peer-reviewed OA journals can be particularly

important for journals with a more limited audience, such as journals focusing

on national law in smaller countries or journals published in a local language,

and for journals where publication fees are inappropriate, such as review

journals which solicit review articles from authors.</li></ul>

<p>3.6.

When subscription-based or non-OA journals permit any kind of self-archiving,

or deposit into OA repositories, they should describe what they permit in

precise human-readable and machine-readable terms, under an open standard.

These descriptions should include at least the version that may be deposited,

the timing of deposits, and the licenses that could be attached to deposited

versions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.7. OA repositories should provide tools, already available at

no charge, to convert deposits made in PDF format into machine-readable formats

such as XML.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.8. Research institutions, including research funders, should

support the development and maintenance of the tools, directories, and

resources essential to the progress and sustainability of OA.</p>

<ul><li>The list of essential tools will evolve over time, but includes

OA repositories and journals, free and open-source repository software, free

and open-source journal management software, tools for text- and data-mining,

directories of OA journals and repositories, directories of university and

funder policies, providers of open licenses, digital preservation services,

current awareness services, services for cross-linking and persistent URLs, and

search engines.<br /><br /></li><li>Research institutions should also support the establishment of

worldwide, open standards for metadata and querying that publishers and

repositories could implement to make OA research more discoverable,

retrievable, and useful.</li></ul>

<p>3.9. We should improve and apply the tools necessary to harvest

the references or bibliographic citations from published literature. The facts

about who cited whom are in the public domain, and should be OA in standard

formats for use, reuse, and analysis. This will assist researchers and research

institutions in knowing what literature exists, even if they don’t have access

to it, and in the development of new metrics for access and impact.</p>

<ul><li>We urge all publishers to cooperate with this effort.<br /><br /></li><li>We recommend the development of infrastructure where reference

data may be deposited by publishers, authors, volunteers, third-party

entrepreneurs, or software, and where the reference data may be hosted for OA

distribution.</li></ul>

<p>3.10. We should assist in the gathering, organizing, and

disseminating of OA metadata in standard formats for all new and old

publications, including non-OA publications.</p>

<p>3.11. Scholarly publishers need infrastructure for cross-linking

and persistent URLs based on open standards, available at no charge, and

supporting linking and attribution at arbitrary levels of granularity, such as

paragraph-level, image-level, and assertion-level identification.</p>

<p>3.12.

We

encourage the further development of open standards for interoperability, and

tools to implement those standards in OA journals and repositories.</p>

<p>

3.13. We

encourage experiments with different methods of post-publication review, and

research into their effectiveness.</p>

<ul><li>OA through repositories, OA through journals, and OA through

books are all compatible with every kind of traditional pre-publication peer

review, and OA does not presuppose any particular form of peer review. We

recommend experiments with post-publication peer review not because it will be

superior, although it might, but because it would reduce delays before new work

becomes OA and could reduce first-copy costs.</li></ul>

<p>3.14. We encourage experiments with new forms of the scholarly

research “article” and “book” in which texts are integrated in useful ways with

underlying data, multimedia elements, executable code, related literature, and

user commentary.</p>

<ul><li>We encourage experiments to take better advantage of the digital

medium, and digital networks, for the benefit of research.<br /><br /></li><li>We encourage experiments to take better advantage of the ways in

which OA articles remove access barriers for machines, and not just for human

readers.<br /><br /></li><li>We encourage the use of open standards and formats to foster

these uses, and research on their effectiveness.</li></ul>

<p><strong>4. On advocacy and coordination</strong></p>

<p>4.1. We

should do more to make publishers, editors, referees and researchers aware of

standards of professional conduct for OA publishing, for example on licensing,

editorial process, soliciting submissions, disclosing ownership, and the

handling of publication fees. Editors, referees and researchers should evaluate

opportunities to engage with publishers and journals on the basis of these

standards of professional conduct. Where publishers are not meeting these

standards we should help them improve as a first step.</p>

<ul><li>As one means for evaluating a new or unknown OA publisher or OA

journal, we recommend that researchers consult the Open Access Scholarly

Publishers Association (OASPA) and its code of conduct. Members of the

association are screened according to this code. Complaints about OASPA-member

publishers and suggestions for improving the code of conduct should be sent to

OASPA.<br /><br /></li><li>We encourage all OA publishers and OA journals to apply best

practices recommended by OASPA or to seek membership in the association, which

would entail a review of their practices and an opportunity to amend these

where necessary.</li></ul>

<p>4.2. We should develop guidelines to universities and funding

agencies considering OA policies, including recommended policy terms, best

practices, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<p>4.3. We encourage development of a consolidated resource where

it is easy to follow the progress of OA through the most relevant numbers and

graphics. Each bit of information should be updated regularly, and its

provenance or method of computation clearly indicated.</p>

<p>4.4. The OA community should act in concert more often. Wherever

possible, OA organizations and activists should look for ways to coordinate

their activities and communications in order to make better use of their

resources, minimize duplication of effort, strengthen the message, and

demonstrate cohesion.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>We should create better mechanisms for communicating and

coordinating with one another.<br /><br /></li><li>We should reach out to our academic colleagues, to the academic

press, and the mainstream non-academic press. The academic and non-academic media

are better informed about OA, and more interested in it, than at any time in

our history. This is an opportunity for helping to educate all stakeholder

groups about OA and new proposals to advance it.</li></ul>

<p>4.5. The worldwide campaign for OA to research articles should

work more closely with the worldwide campaigns for OA to books, theses and

dissertations, research data, government data, educational resources, and

source code.</p>

<ul><li>We should coordinate with kindred efforts less directly

concerned with access to research, such as copyright reform, orphan works,

digital preservation, digitizing print literature, evidence-based

policy-making, the freedom of speech, and the evolution of libraries,

publishing, peer review, and social media.<br /><br /></li><li>We should look for ways to amplify our separate voices when

defending common principles.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>4.6. We need to articulate more clearly, with more evidence, and

to more stakeholder groups the following truths about OA:</p>

<ul><li>OA benefits research and researchers, and the lack of OA impedes

them.<br /><br /></li><li>OA for publicly-funded research benefits taxpayers and increases

the return on their investment in research. It has economic benefits as well as

academic or scholarly benefits.<br /><br /></li><li>OA amplifies the social value of research, and OA policies

amplify the social value of funding agencies and research institutions.<br /><br /></li><li>The costs of OA can be

recovered without adding more money to the current system of scholarly

communication.<br /><br /></li><li>OA is consistent with copyright law everywhere in the world, and

gives both authors and readers more rights than they have under conventional

publishing agreements.<br /><br /></li><li>OA is consistent with the highest standards of quality.</li></ul>
