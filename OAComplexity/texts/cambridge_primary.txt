OA can also allow content to be published in a way that allows readers to redistribute, re-use and adapt the content in new works. We support two types of OA:</p>
<p><strong>Gold Open Access</strong> is an alternative to subscriptions and other access payments. Content is published under a <a title="Creative commons licenses" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/open-access-resources/creative-commons-licenses">Creative Commons</a> licence that allows free access and redistribution and, in many cases, allows re-use in new or derivative works. Typically, but not always, Gold OA content is supported by an Article Processing Charge (APC) paid by the author or their funder. We also publish Gold OA content that is supported by other financial models, particularly in humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p><em>Hybrid journals</em> are subscription journals that offer authors the choice of paying an APC to publish their articles as Gold OA.</p>

<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Green Open Access</strong> (also known as Green archiving)&nbsp;is the practice of making a version of a work freely accessible in an institutional or subject archive or some other document repository. Typically the author’s original (submitted) manuscript is made available, or the manuscript as it was accepted for publication after peer-review changes have been made. For some types of books, a portion of the final published version can also be made available</p>
<p><strong><em>Social sharing</em></strong> is similar to Green OA except that documents are typically shared in a commercial sharing site or scholarly collaboration network site, rather than an institutional repository. See our <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/social-sharing">social sharing page</a> for more information. Our Green OA policies include provisions for social sharing and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/coreshare">Cambridge Core Share</a> also provides a means for sharing&nbsp;the published versions of journal articles.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>Cambridge University Press has a set of policies to allow authors, librarians and others to meet the Green OA requirements of their institutions and funders.</p>
