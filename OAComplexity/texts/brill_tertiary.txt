<p>Brill  Open is Brill’s program in Open Access publishing. Brill offers an Open  Access solution for all types of publication: articles, journal issues,  entire journals, chapters, books, book series, and reference works.</p>
<h3>Why Publish in Open Access with Brill?</h3>
<p><strong>Visibility</strong>: With Open Access, your work is freely  available to as broad an audience as possible. It boosts downloads and  citations. You are also free to share it wherever you like. Increase  usage and impact of your research by sharing your work in institutional  and commercial repositories such as <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.academia.edu/">academia.edu</a>, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net">researchgate.net</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.mendeley.com">mendeley.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance</strong>: More and more research councils, funding  bodies and institutions have a mandate in place requiring you to  publish in Open Access. Brill aims to be compliant with all  institutional policies, and is fully compliant with the policy of  national and European funders such as the RCUK and ERC; as well as with  the policy of independent organizations such as the Wellcome Trust. An  exhaustive and up to date overview of all Open Access mandates and  policies can be found via <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://roarmap.eprints.org/">ROARMAP</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Quality and Speed</strong>: All of Brill’s manuscripts are  peer reviewed, often double-blind, by expert reviewers. Solid quality  control is Brill’s top priority for its entire publishing program,  including our Open Access publications. Our in-house editors will  support and advise you during the publication process. We aim to work to  strict deadlines in order to have your book or article published and  brought to market as soon as possible. Almost all Brill Open  publications are also published in print.</p>
<p><strong>Sales and Marketing</strong>: Our dedicated sales and  marketing team works with all relevant academic, corporate and  government libraries around the world, thus assuring the widest possible  exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Open Access for books</strong>: If you choose to participate  in our Open Book program, your book will be made available  electronically in Open Access immediately upon publication. This means  no embargo will be applicable. The OA version will be listed in the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.doabooks.org/">Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB)</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oapen.org">OAPEN library</a>.  The OA version is distributed to libraries in the same way as a regular  e-book, meaning that your library can subscribe to receive the metadata  so that you can find it in the catalogue.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid and full OA for journals</strong>: Brill publishes  more than 270 journals covering a wide variety of disciplines in the  humanities, international law and social sciences. All of our journals  offer a ‘hybrid’ Open Access publishing solution (allowing both Open  Access and non-Open Access submissions), and in addition we publish  several full Open Access journals.</p>
