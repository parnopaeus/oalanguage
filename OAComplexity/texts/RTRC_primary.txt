<p>Luckily for students, doctors, patients, and everyone else who relies on academic journals, there is a proven alternative to costly subscription-based based journals. &#160;Using the Internet, research can be distributed to a wider audience at a very low marginal cost – the difference between what it costs to distribute an article to one person or to one million people is very small. &#160;Instead of locking information behind price barriers, research can reach anyone who needs it, regardless of university affiliation, geographic location, or ability to pay. &#160;It’s time for a new model – it’s time for Open Access.&#160; &#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="" src="http://old.arl.org/r2research/bm~pix/screen-shot-2010-03-26-at-11-20-48-pm~s400x400.png" /><h3>Open Access (OA) is the free, immediate, unrestricted availability of high-quality, peer-reviewed scholarship over the Internet – combined with the rights to use this information to its fullest possible extent. &#160;</h3> 
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none">Open Access ensures that the results of scholarly research&#160;are made available online for anyone to freely use, immediately upon publication,&#160;and removes barriers&#160;to scholarly and educational re-use.&#160; It recognizes that while there are legitimate costs associated with formal publication, these can be effectively covered in ways that do not require toll barriers for users to access an article.</p>

<p style="margin-top:.1pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in; margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;"><span style="Times New Roman&quot;">Open Access is made possible in a number of ways, including:</span><ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li style="margin-top:.1pt;margin-bottom:.1pt;">
<p><span style="Times New Roman&quot;">Open-access      journals that make their articles freely available at the time of      publication</span></p>
</li> 
<li style="margin-top:.1pt;margin-bottom:.1pt;">
<p><span style="Times New Roman&quot;">Open      digital repositories,&#160;where articles are deposited and can be indexed      and accessed by anyone with an&#160;Internet&#160;connection</span></p>
</li> 
<li style="margin-top:.1pt;margin-bottom:.1pt;">
<p><span style="Times New Roman&quot;">Effectively      managed copyright – authors are retaining the rights they need to ensure their      articles can be accessed and used by the widest possible audience, and be      published in the most prestigious venue</span></p>
</li> 
<li style="margin-top:.1pt;margin-bottom:.1pt;">
<p><span style="Times New Roman&quot;">Local,      national and international policies that support Open Access to scholarly      research results</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;">Open Access has achieved remarkable success to date: more&#160;than 5,000 open-access journals are published&#160;today, accounting for&#160;approximately 20% of all published journals</span><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;"><a href="http://www.arl.org/learn/solution/index.shtml#1"><sup><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;">1</span></sup></a></span><sup><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;">,</span></sup><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;"><a href="http://www.arl.org/learn/solution/index.shtml#2"><sup><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;">2</span></sup></a></span><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;">; &#160;millions of articles are&#160;currently being made available via open-access repositories; and dozens of proposed and established policies from universities and research&#160;funders are in play in support of Open Access</span><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;"><a href="http://www.arl.org/learn/solution/index.shtml#3"><sup><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;">3</span></sup></a></span><span style="Times New Roman&quot;;">;&#160;but still much more needs to be done.</span></p>
