 

Open Access Publishing PLUS 

 


An Overview for Graduate Schools and Libraries 

 

Overview 

With the Open Access Publishing PLUS from ProQuest publishing option, graduate students 
can publish their dissertations and theses with ProQuest on an open access basis. Once 
published, open access graduate works will be made available in the following ways, ensuring 
the widest possible exposure of the author’s graduate research: 

 

. PQDT: Open access graduate works will be available for free download to all users of 
the ProQuest® Dissertations & Theses (PQDT) database, the world’s most 
comprehensive collection of dissertations and theses. 
. PQDT Open: Open access titles can be retrieved via the ProQuest database PQDT 
Open (<a href="http://pqdtopen.proquest.com">). Anyone with access to the Internet will be able to 
read and download open access dissertations and theses for free. 


 

Fee 

The Open Access Publishing PLUS publishing option costs $95. This one-time fee funds the 
perpetual hosting of the student’s work for electronic public access. 

 

Choosing Open Access Publishing 

Our publishing agreement allows students to specify their choice of either Open Access 
Publishing PLUS or Traditional publishing when they submit. They will pay the fee for Open 
Access Publishing PLUS publishing as determined by their graduate institution (graduate works 
submitted via the ProQuest Electronic Theses and Dissertation Administrator and published via 
Traditional Publishing). The university may choose to cover, or to subsidize, the Open Access 
Publishing PLUS publishing fee. 

 

Open Access Publishing PLUS from ProQuest versus Traditional Publishing 

All of the same services and processes that go into Traditional publishing efforts will apply to 

Open Access Publishing PLUS from ProQuest. They will be indexed, microfilmed, preserved 
and archived as they have always been.
