HowOpenIsIt? 


Thousands of journals have adopted policies that embrace some or all of the Open Access core 
components related to readership, reuse, copyright, author and automatic posting, and machine 
readability. 

But not all Open Access is created equal 

The “HowOpenIsIt?®” Open Access Spectrum (OAS) guide provides standardized Open Access 
terminology in an easily understandable, comprehensive resource created by PLOS, the 
Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (<a href="sparcopen.org">SPARC) and the Open Access 
Scholarly Publishers Association (<a href="oaspa.org">OASPA) based on core components of Open Access derived 
from the 2002 Budapest Open Access Initiative (<a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/openaccess/read">BOAI). 

The OAS guide illustrates a nuanced continuum of more versus less open to enable users to 
compare and contrast publications and policies across a grid of clearly defined 
components, moving the conversation from “Is It Open Access?” to “HowOpenIsIt?” 

The HowOpenisit? Open Access Spectrum guide 
illustrates the continuum from more open to less open. 

1. Brings a broad understanding of Open Access to those unfamiliar with its nuances 
2. Deepens the understanding of those already familiar with Open Access 
3. Enables users to compare and contrast publications and policies and to determine how 
open is a publisher and/or publication 
4. Standardizes terminology and clarifies the definition of Open Access

HowOpenIsIt? was vetted and refined in a practical use pilot of 100 journals by PLOS, SPARC 
and <a href="http://publications.copernicus.org/">Copernicus Publications in consultation with OASPA, Securing a Hybrid Environment for 


Research Preservation and Access (<a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/">SHERPA) and Infrastructures for Open Access (<a href="http://is4oa.org/">IS4OA). 
Through the work of volunteer translators, the guide is available in multiple languages (see 
below) for use around the world by authors, libraries, research funders, government agencies, 
institutions and other interested parties. 

 

As increasing numbers of hybrid publishing models develop, the challenge lies in clearly 
understanding where each journal lies on the continuum. To address this, the <a href="http://www.oaspectrum.org/">Open Access 
Spectrum Evaluation Tool – based on HowOpenIsIt? – provides a quantitative score of a 
journal’s degree of openness. The OAS evaluation tool, created and updated by a team of 
scholarly communication and publishing experts including representatives from DOAJ and 
librarians from the US, Europe and Africa, currently maintains a database of more than 1,000 
journals. 


The guide is available for download in a number of languages through the work of volunteer 
translators.
