												<p>Open Access is a term used to describe content that a reader can access free of charge. With the ProQuest Open Access Publishing PLUS option, graduate students can significantly increase the reach of their research.</p>
<p><b>What are the benefits of Open Access Publishing PLUS?<br /> </b>Open Access Publishing PLUS guarantees the widest possible exposure of your graduate research. It can also help ensure that the officially published version of your dissertation or thesis is the most widely available version in the primary literature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the standard features of our traditional publishing service, such as rigorous quality assurance, assignment of an ISBN, and permanent storage in our microfilm vault, the Open Access publishing service also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free, public access to your      graduate work in&nbsp;PQDT Open , our online repository of Open Access graduate works.</li>
<li>Free access to the citation,      abstract, and full text (including supplementary files) for your graduate      works for all institutional subscribers to ProQuest&reg; Dissertations &amp;      Theses (PQDT), the database of record for graduate research.</li>
