  <h3><a name="whatoa"></a>What is Open Access?</h3>
  <p><b>Open Access is . . .</b><br>
    If an article is &quot;Open Access&quot; it means that it can be freely accessed 
    by anyone in the world using an internet connection. This means that the potential 
    readership of Open Access articles is far, far greater than that for articles 
    where the full-text is restricted to subscribers. Evidence shows that making 
    research material Open Access increases the number of readers and significantly 
    increases citations to the article - in some fields increasing citations by 
    300%. </p>
  <p><b>What Open Access is <i>not</i></b><br>
    It is important to point out that Open Access does not affect peer-review; 
    articles are peer-reviewed and published in journals in the normal way. There 
    is no suggestion that authors should use repositories instead of journals. 
    Open Access repositories supplement and do not replace journals. Some authors 
    have feared that wider availability will increase plagiarism: in fact, if 
    anything, Open Access serves to <i>reduce</i> plagiarism. When material is 
    freely available the chance that plagiarism is recognised and exposed is that 
    much higher. </p>
  <p><b>What is the problem?</b><br>
    Journal price rises over the last decade mean that most universities can no 
    longer afford subscriptions to all of the journals that their academics need. 
    Even if a journal is available on-line, this does not mean it is freely available: 
    university libraries pay large subscriptions to allow their academics to easily 
    access journal materials on-line. Price rises that are many times the rate 
    of inflation continue to be imposed each year, further restricting access 
    to journal articles. The situation is even worse in the developing world, 
    where journal subscription prices mean that many institutions simply cannot 
    afford access to up-to-date research.</p>
  <p><b>Open Access Solutions</b><br>
    Open Access addresses these problems by taking the results of research that 
    has already been paid for and making it freely available on-line, through 
    repositories and websites. This process can have significant advantages for 
    individual authors, for researchers, for institutions and for the process 
    of research generally by freeing up the process of dissemination. Many funders 
    have recognised that the job of research is only half-done if the results 
    of that research cannot reach the widest audience. Some are formulating policies 
    to require Open Access to their funded research.</p>
  <p><b>Public Access<br>
    </b> Another aspect is that on a national level, most research is publicly 
    funded and yet the general public cannot get access to the results that have 
    been paid for by their taxes. For example, the majority of research paid for 
    and carried out by the National Health Service is not freely available - even 
    to NHS staff. Restricting access to research has many disadvantages. For instance, 
    it means that there is often no readily accessible material available to science 
    journalists or the public to counter the regular scare-stories or reputed 
    miracle cures widely reported in the mass media.</p>
  <p><b>Open Access Repositories</b><br>
    Open Access repositories can hold digital duplicates of published articles 
    and make them freely available. Subject to copyright (<a href="#journalrules">see 
    below</a>) authors can deposit copies of their finished articles in repositories 
    alongside their publication in normal journals. The available evidence shows 
    that this does not affect journal subscriptions. If the subject-discipline 
    circulates unrefereed <i>pre-prints</i> or <i>working papers</i> in advance 
    of publication (like Physics, or Economics), then these can be deposited. 
    If an accepted method of communication is through conference papers (like 
    Computer Science), then these can be deposited: similarly for fields that 
    use book chapters or reports. Other fields like Biomedicine only circulate 
    refereed <i>post-prints</i>. Repositories tag peer-reviewed material to make 
    this status clear. The important point is that repositories reflect and support 
    the existing research culture of the discipline.</p>
  <p>The system works by these electronic versions of article, or <i>eprints</i>, 
    being deposited into a database, or repository. These repositories are mainly 
    administered by research institutions, which confers the advantage of allowing 
    local support of users. Such <i>institutional repositories</i> share records 
    about their content with service providers, who then offer search services 
    to users across every record that they hold. This means that a researcher 
    using a search service is searching across all repositories, not just individual 
    ones. Once the researcher finds a record, then they can view the full-text 
    direct from the instutional repository. As well as services which just search 
    repositories, the full-text is also searched by Google, Yahoo and others.</p>
  <p>There are increasing numbers of open access repositories available around 
    the world. The <a href="HTTP://www.OpenDOAR.org">OpenDOAR</a> service allows 
    you to <a href="http://www.opendoar.org/find.php">search for repositories</a> 
    or for <a href="http://www.opendoar.org/search.php">repository content</a>. 
    A list of <a href="http://www.opendoar.org/find.php?search=&clID=&ctID=&submit=Filter&cID=224&lID=&rSoftWareName=&format=summary&step=20&sort=r.rName&rID=&ctrl=new&p=1">repositories 
    based in the UK</a> is available.</p>
  <p><b>Open Access Journals</b><br>
    An alternate way of providing Open Access is to publish in an Open Access 
    Journal. These journals make their articles available for free through charging 
    for the publication services <i>before</i> publication, rather than <i>after</i> 
    publication through subscriptions. Open Access publication charges can be 
    often included within the costs of research funding, so the money for access 
    comes through the research funder, rather than through the library budget. 
    Of course, the initial source of the money is often the same (from government 
    funding), but the economics of this model means that the overall cost is lower. 
    There are a growing number of Open Access Journals, with a journal available 
    in most disciplines. A list of the ones currently available is provided by 
    the <a href="http://www.doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>Some publishers are now experimenting with hybrid journals, where the subscription 
    version is still sold, but for a supplement - typically around $3000 each 
    - an articles can then be made freely available. It has been noted that far 
    from reducing costs, this increases the overall cost of publication. However, 
    while the Open Access model catches on, this is one way that articles can 
    be made freely available. </p>
  <p><b>Depositing in Repositories</b><br>
    There is no charge for using institutional repositories. The process of deposition 
    typically takes about 10 minutes and consists of filling in a web-based form 
    with details about the article; then attaching a pdf copy (or similar), and 
    then submitting it to the repository administrator. Repositories have help-systems 
    and guidance: some institutions may offer personal assistance for the first 
    few times you deposit. The process is quick and simple and will mean that 
    the article is then available world-wide to a vastly increased readership. 
  </p>
  <p>Be sure when writing an article to keep a copy of the final version, after 
    all the changes due to peer-review have been integrated in the text. Publishers 
    sometimes refuse permission for authors to use the version which have been 
    typeset, but allow authors to use their own final version, even though the 
    content of the article is exactly the same. If you no longer have your own 
    copy, then sometimes your editor might be able to supply you with a copy of 
    what you sent them. However, it is always easier to keep your own copy of 
    your final version.</p>
  <h3><a name="funderrurles"></a>Funders' Grant Rules</h3>
  <p>A number of research funders now have rules in place which make deposit in 
    an open access repository a requirement of any grant. Other funders make a 
    strong recommendation for deposit, or may make additional funds available 
    for publication in an open access journal, or in one of the hybrid journals 
    set up by some publishers. </p>
  <p>SHERPA runs a service called <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/">JULIET</a>, 
    as a complement to the <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php">RoMEO</a> 
    service, which lists these rules and recommendations. Use the list to check 
    to see if a particular funder has an open access requirement for research 
    outputs.</p>
  <p>A briefing paper created and distributed to University of Nottingham academics 
    on the practical requirements of the major research funders on scholarly output, 
    <a href="../documents/sherpaplusdocs/Nottingham-research-output-procedures-May07.pdf">is 
    available here</a>. </p>
  <h3><a name="journalrules"></a>Journals' Copyright Rules</h3>
  <p>There may be copyright restrictions in making an eprint freely available. 
    Although the majority of publisher and journals allow authors to archive their 
    work under certain conditions, other publishers are more restrictive.</p>
  <p>Typically, when an article is published, the author assigns copyright, or 
    gives a copyright license to the publisher. Depending on the particular agreement 
    that is signed, the author retains more or less rights to use the article. 
    Some agreements forbid the author from photocopying the article, using it 
    in teaching, or mounting it on-line. Other agreements are more liberal and 
    allow the author to retain rights to use the article as they wish. </p>
  <p>SHERPA runs the <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php">RoMEO</a> service, 
    which lists publishers and their associated copyright agreements. Use the 
    RoMEO service to search for a publisher, or a particular journal, to see what 
    rights are assigned to publishers and which are retained by the author.</p>
  <h3><a name="whichrepos"></a>Which Repository</h3>
  <p>Funders may have requirements for research to be deposited in a particular 
    repository: some subject-based repositories have been set-up for this purpose. 
    SHERPA runs a service called <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/juliet/">JULIET</a> 
    which lists funders' rules and if they have a requirement for authors to use 
    a particular repository. </p>
  <p>Otherwise, the great majority of research-led universities in the UK already 
    have an institutional repository for use by their staff. A list of UK <a href="instcontacts.html">institutional 
    repositories and contacts</a> is available from this site. If you belong to 
    one of these institutions, then such a repository is probably the best place 
    to hold your eprint. Remember, other researchers will find the eprint irrespective 
    of which repository holds it - the place you store the eprint is not necessarily 
    the way that people will use to find the eprint. </p>
  <p>If your institution does not yet have a repository, then if you work for 
    an academic institution in the UK, there is now a service called &quot;<a href="HTTP://depot.Edina.AC.UK">the 
    Depot</a>&quot; where you can deposit research articles on an open access 
    basis. In time, as more institutions establish their own repositories, material 
    will be transferred from the Depot to the appropriate institutional repository. 
    This will be done automatically and access will be maintained at all times.</p>
  <p>As part of the SHERPA project, the British Library has set up a <a href="http://sherpa.bl.uk/">pilot 
    repository</a> for use by unaffiliated scholars from the UK who use the Library's 
    facilities and who are not directly associated with a particular institution.</p>
  <p> There are some moves underway to provide general repositories for use by 
    academics without access to archive facilities in the UK, the USA and elsewhere. 
    Until these initiatives come to fruition, for authors outside the UK without 
    an institutional repository, there are a small number of subject-based repositories 
    elsewhere in the world which might be able to hold your material. SHERPA runs 
    a service called <a href="http://www.opendoar.org/">OpenDOAR</a> which lists 
    repositories world-wide. Use <a href="http://www.opendoar.org/">OpenDOAR</a> 
    to see if your subject-discipline has a general repository you can use. </p>
  <h3><a name="assistance"></a>Assistance</h3>
  <p>Repository systems are designed to allow academics to archive their own work. 
    It is generally a simple process and should take no more than 10 minutes. 
    Like other IT systems, when coming to it for the first time the process might 
    take slightly longer; but the input form is straight forward.</p>
  <p>If you belong to a SHERPA partner institution, then there is someone in your 
    organisation who is able to advise or assist you in depositing your eprint. 
    A list of <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/contacts.html">SHERPA Officers</a> 
    is available, listed by institution. Other institutions also have archives 
    and provide assistance: a list of these <a href="instcontacts.html">repositories 
    and contacts</a> is available. We will maintain this and update the list as 
    new repositories and contacts develop. </p>
