<h2>Your Work. Your Rights.</h2>
<p>When you decide to publish an article in a peer-reviewed journal, you own the full copyrights to that article. If you publish in an open access journal, you retain your full copyrights. However, if you choose to publish in a traditional subscription access journal, you will be required to sign a form transferring some – or all – of your copyrights to that publisher.</p>
<p>That doesn’t have to be the end of the story. When you sign a copyright transfer form, <strong>you</strong> can decide which rights you want to keep, and which you want to give away. Understanding the effect of fully exercising the rights you have as an author can help you make educated choices about the publishing outlets you choose to submit work to. SPARC provides a full set of resources to help you learn more about your rights as an author, and the tools that are available to help you effectively manage your copyrights.</p>

<h2>SPARC Author Rights Brochure</h2>
<p>Do you want to retain the right to post your article on your course website, or in your institution’s digital repository? Do you want to share copies of your articles with your colleagues or students?</p>
<p>These and other questions are heard more and more frequently on campuses. That’s why SPARC has developed Author Rights – an educational initiative that informs faculty across all disciplines about their copyrights, and how to use the SPARC Author Addendum to effectively manage your rights as a journal article author to ensure that your article can be accessed and used as broadly as possible.</p>
