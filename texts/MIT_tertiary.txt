<div class="content">
<p><a href="http://libraries.mit.edu/news/electrochemical-society/21687/">MIT Libraries’ subscription</a> to <a href="http://ecsdl.org/site/misc/ecs_plus.xhtml"> ECS Plus</a> provides MIT authors with free, unlimited credits to publish articles open access. <a href="http://ecsdl.org/site/misc/ecs_plus.xhtml">Here&#8217;s how it works</a> (from ECS):</p>
<p>&#8220;When authors submit a paper, they will be able to look up whether or not their institution subscribes to ECS Plus. As part of the <a title="[opens in a new window]" href="http://ecsjournals.msubmit.net/" target="_blank" rel="external-nw noopener noreferrer">manuscript submission process</a>, they will need to select Author Choice Open Access, and at that stage they can indicate that they will be claiming an Article Credit because they come from an ECS Plus subscribing institution.</p>
<p>When their paper has been accepted, they will be sent an e-mail inviting them to claim their Article Credit through CCC RightsLink, who handle our APC transactions. Once in the RightsLink system, they simply need to click “Apply Discounts” and search for their institution to apply their Article Credit. For more information, you can <a title="[opens in a new window]" href="http://ecsdl.org/site/ecs/2016_ecs_oa_guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external-nw noopener noreferrer">view our entire Open Access workflow here</a></p>
<p>We will also contact active authors from every ECS Plus subscribing institution to let them know their institution is a subscriber and that they can take advantage of their Article Credits next time they submit a paper.&#8221;</p>
