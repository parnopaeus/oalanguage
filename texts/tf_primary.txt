<p>Open access isn’t just about others being able to read your research without barriers. OA also gives researchers greater opportunity to build upon the work of others. Most OA articles have a Creative Commons license which explains how others can use them. In some cases, it may give complete freedom to reuse and repurpose the published work. Regardless, it’s always necessary to acknowledge the original author.</p>
<p>At Taylor &amp; Francis, we offer a range of Creative Commons licensing options, so you can find the right fit for your research. <strong><a href="#creativecommons">See our guide to copyright licenses for more information</a></strong>.</p>

Open access is one part of this larger drive for more openness in scholarly communication. Open research, also called <strong>‘open science’</strong> or <strong>‘open scholarship’</strong>, looks beyond the peer-reviewed journal article or book. There are many other outputs of the research cycle that are useful for fellow academics who want to understand and build upon your work. This can include research data, code, and lab notes. <strong><a href="#openresearch">Find out how Taylor &amp; Francis can help you achieve your open research aims</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Look out for this indicator at the top of the journal home page on Taylor &amp; Francis Online. Or, use our <strong><a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-open-access/oa-options-finder">open access options finder</a></strong>.</p>

<h5><strong>What do I need to do to publish my article OA in an Open Select journal?</strong></h5>
<p>Once you have submitted your paper it will go through rigorous peer review as normal. If the journal accepts it, you’ll receive an email inviting you to select a publishing license. This will include the option to make your article gold open access. It usually requires the payment of an APC.</p>
<h5><strong>Do I have to pay an APC to publish in an Open Select journal?</strong></h5>
<p>No. If you don’t pay the APC, your work will be published as a standard article, available to journal subscribers. In that case, you can still <strong><a href="#Green OA">make your work open access using the green OA route</a></strong>.</p>
<h5><strong>Can I make my article gold OA if it has already been published in a subscription journal?</strong></h5>
<p>Yes, if your work has been published as a standard article in an Open Select (hybrid) journal, you can choose to make it gold open access later:</p>
<ol>
<li>Email our OA Support Team at apc@tandf.co.uk explaining that you wish to make your article open access. Please include the title and Digital Object Identifier (DOI) of your article.</li>
<li>You will receive an invoice for the APC to make your article open access, along with a new author publishing agreement to sign.</li>
<li>Your article will then be made OA so that it’s permanently available for anyone to read, anywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>Standard APCs apply if you are making your article OA retrospectively. Discounts may be available if your institution has an <strong><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/openaccess/members">OA membership</a></strong> or is part of an <strong><a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/oa-agreements/">OA agreement</a></strong>.</p>

Please note that <strong><a href="#Repositories">an embargo period usually applies</a></strong>. The <strong><a href="#Sharing">Sharing your open access research</a></strong> section below outlines the different versions of your article and how you can share them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Zero-embargo green open access for Archives and Library &amp; Information Science (LIS) journals </strong></h5>
<p>Researchers publishing in an LIS or Archives journal can take advantage of the green open access route immediately upon publication, without needing to observe an embargo period. This means authors can post a version of their article to any subject or institutional repository straight away. <strong><a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-open-access/zero-embargo-green-open-access">Find out more</a></strong>.</p>

<h3>A guide to sharing different versions of your article</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://groups.niso.org/publications/rp/RP-8-2008.pdf">National Information Standards Organization</a></strong>, in partnership with the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers, has defined the following versions:</p>
<div class="pillar__icon pillar__icon--left" data-iconweight="" style="font-weight: 100;"><i class="fal fa-file-alt"></i></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-10 pillar__repeater--item"><div class="pillar__repeater--block pillar__repeater--type-standard--title"><h3>Version of Record (VoR)</h3></div><div class="pillar__repeater--block pillar__repeater--type-standardicon"><blockquote><p>“A fixed version of a journal article that has been made available by … a publisher by formally and exclusively declaring the article ‘published’.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>This is the final, definitive, citable version of your paper. It has been copy-edited, typeset, had metadata applied, and has been allocated a DOI. This is the version published on Taylor &amp; Francis Online.</p>
<p>The VoR includes any “early release” article that is formally identified as being published even before the compilation of a volume issue and assignment of associated metadata, as long as it is citable via some permanent identifier(s).</p>
<p><strong>How can I share it?</strong></p>
<p>If you have chosen to publish your article gold open access, you can share this final version however you wish. This includes depositing it in repositories and sharing it online.</p>
<p>Please do not share a PDF of the VoR if you have not published your article gold open access. Instead, you will need to use either your Author’s Original Manuscript (AOM) or Accepted Manuscript (AM). We recommend that you include a link to the VoR from anywhere you post an earlier version of your article.</p>
<div class="pillar__icon pillar__icon--right" data-iconweight="" style="font-weight: 100;"><i class="fal fa-file-pdf"></i></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-10 pillar__repeater--item"><div class="pillar__repeater--block pillar__repeater--type-standard--title"><h3>Accepted Manuscript (AM)</h3></div><div class="pillar__repeater--block pillar__repeater--type-standardicon"><blockquote><p>“The version of a journal article that has been accepted for publication in a journal.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What is it? </strong></p>
<p>This version is your paper after peer review, when it has been revised and accepted for publication by the journal editor. When you receive the acceptance email from the Editorial Office, keep a copy of your AM for any future posting.</p>
<p><strong>How can I share it?</strong></p>
<p>As a Taylor &amp; Francis author, you can post your AM on your personal website any time after publication. This includes posting to Facebook, Google groups, and LinkedIn, plus linking from Twitter.</p>
<p>Embargoes apply if you are posting the AM to an institutional or subject repository, or to a scholarly collaboration network such as ResearchGate, Mendeley, or Academia.edu. The <strong><a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-open-access/oa-options-finder">open access options finder</a></strong> lists the embargo periods for all Taylor &amp; Francis and Routledge journals.</p>
<p>To encourage citation of your work (and to be able to monitor and understand who is reading it using article metrics), we recommend that you insert a link from your posted AM to the published article on Taylor &amp; Francis Online with the following text:</p>
<p><em>“This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor &amp; Francis in [Journal Title] on [Date of Publication], available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/[Article DOI].”</em></p>
<div class="pillar__icon pillar__icon--left" data-iconweight="" style="font-weight: 100;"><i class="fab fa-facebook-square"></i><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i><i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-10 pillar__repeater--item"><div class="pillar__repeater--block pillar__repeater--type-standard--title"><h3>Author’s Original Manuscript (AOM)</h3></div><div class="pillar__repeater--block pillar__repeater--type-standardicon"><blockquote><p>“Any version of a journal article that is considered by the author to be of sufficient quality to be submitted for formal peer review.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What is it? </strong></p>
<p>The AOM is your original manuscript (sometimes called a “preprint”) before you submitted it to a journal for peer review.</p>
<p><strong>How can I share it?</strong></p>
<p>You can share this as much as you like. If you post it anywhere, including on a scholarly collaboration network, we recommend you use an amended version of the wording below. This will encourage usage and citation of your final, published article (the VoR):</p>
<p><em>“This is the Author’s Original Manuscript of an article published by Taylor &amp; Francis in [Journal Title] on [Date of Publication], available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/[Article DOI].”</em></p>
<div class="pillar__icon pillar__icon--right" data-iconweight="" style="font-weight: 100;"></div></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-10 pillar__repeater--item"><div class="pillar__repeater--block pillar__repeater--type-standard--title"><h3>Institutional repositories</h3></div><div class="pillar__repeater--block pillar__repeater--type-standardicon"><p><img class="size-full wp-image-9490 alignleft" src="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circuitboard.png" alt="" width="264" height="151" /><a name="Repositories"></a>A repository is a digital platform used to host and preserve scholarly outputs. If you’re based at a research institution, you’re probably required to place a version of your article in their repository. If your article has been published gold open access in a Taylor &amp; Francis journal you can deposit a PDF of the VoR in the repository as soon as it’s published.</p>
<p>However, if you choose not to publish gold open access then you’ll need to archive a copy of the AOM or the AM. For most Taylor &amp; Francis journals there is an <strong><a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/journal-list/">embargo period</a></strong> during which the AM should be a closed deposit.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a “closed deposit”?</strong></p>
<p>This is when you post your AM to your institutional repository so that it’s available for those within your institutional network to access. You (or repository staff) can make this an open deposit after the relevant embargo period has passed. AMs can be posted at any point to repositories as closed deposits.</p>
<p><strong>What’s an “open deposit”?</strong></p>
<p>This is when you post your AM to your institutional repository so it’s freely available for anyone to access. All authors should respect embargo periods before making AMs available as an open deposit. You can check the embargo period on all journals in the <strong><a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-open-access/oa-options-finder">open access options finder</a></strong>.</p>

<p>We support <strong><a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/think-check-submit/">Think. Check. Submit.</a></strong>, an initiative launched by a coalition of publishers and industry organizations. It provides the tools to help you choose the right journal for your work.</p>
<p>There are some open access journals which do not provide the quality assurance and services that would be delivered by a reputable journal. For example, they may not ensure thorough peer review and editor feedback or carry out ethics and integrity checks. There are also some fraudulent journals which trade off existing society or journal names. This means that authors may discover too late that their research hasn’t appeared in the title they were expecting.</p>
<p>You should therefore make sure that you submit your work to a journal you can trust.</p>
<p>By using the checklist provided on the <strong><a href="https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/think-check-submit/">Think. Check. Submit. website</a></strong>, you can make an informed choice before sending your articles for review.</p>
<p>The Think. Check. Submit. checklist includes ways to check the credentials of any title and the society or publisher behind it. It isn’t a definitive list of “approved” titles, but it will help make sure your research has maximum impact.<a name="APC funding"></a><a name="funding"></a></p>

<li>Submit through the journal’s online submission system in the usual way. You should follow the Instructions for Authors found on Taylor &amp; Francis Online.</li>
<li>During the submission process you will be asked whether you wish to request a discount or waiver. Please select the appropriate option at this stage. Our open access team will then ensure the appropriate discount or waiver is applied.</li>
<li>Your paper will go through peer review as normal. Journal editors or reviewers won’t see requests for a discount or waiver and it won’t influence the outcome of your submission.</li>
<li>If accepted, your article will be published open access, meaning anyone, anywhere can read your research.</li>

</div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-10 pillar__repeater--item"><div class="pillar__repeater--block pillar__repeater--type-standardicon"><p>At Taylor &amp; Francis we want to bring these outputs to the surface. Visibility will enrich the reading experience and means that results can be verified and reproduced. Open research also ensures that researchers are given credit for all their valuable work.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways Taylor &amp; Francis is supporting the open research goals of our authors:</p>

In fact, some funders are now making data sharing a requirement.</p>
<p>Sharing data publicly improves the robustness of the research process. It supports validation, research transparency, reproducibility and replicability of results. Depositing data in a repository mints a permanent identifier, such as a DOI. This allows authors and others to cite the data set and researchers to get appropriate credit for their work.</p>
