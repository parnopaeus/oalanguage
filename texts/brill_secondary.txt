<p>Brill offers all authors the option to publish in Open Access. This is available for journals contributions, as well as full books or individual book chapters. Publishing in Open Access means that the online version of your work will be free to access for anyone. Depending on the exact license you choose, you can also free your work from certain restrictions on its use. Publishing in Open Access is done in exchange for a Publication Charge. This Publication Charge is only payable after your work has been accepted for publication, so post-peer review.<br/>
<br/>
You may wish to publish in Open Access because of funder or grant requirements, a mandate by a national research council, or simply because of personal choice. If you are interested in more information on why you should publish in Open Access with Brill, please see <a href="/page/OpenAccessGeneral/general">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While Brill only offers Open Access in exchange for a Publication Charge (“Gold” Open Access), and does not offer any “Green” Open Access options (Open Access after an embargo period), we encourage you to first review our <a href="/page/RightsPermissions/rights-and-permissions#selfarchiving">Self-Archiving Rights</a> to see whether these meet your requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that Brill participates in several <a href="/page/DevelopingCountriesProgram/brills-developing-countries-program">developing countries programs</a>, which means that authors from developing countries may be eligible for a significant discount on or a full waiver of the Open Access publication charges. Depending on whether your employing institution is part of our <a href="/page/OpenAccessforSocieties/open-access-for-societies-and-institutions">Membership Program</a>, you may also be entitled to a discount. To find out if you qualify for any discount, please contact <a href="mailto:brillopen@brill.com">brillopen@brill.com</a>.<br/>
<strong><br/>
So what does that mean?</strong></p>

    <li>Free access for all (your publication is not behind a paywall)</li>
    <li>Author pays, or their funder</li>
    <li>Payment only after peer review and acceptance</li>
    <li>The author will need to sign an agreement specific for Open Access</li>
</ul>

<p>More specifics on publishing Open Access in Books or Journals and the related Publication Charges can be found in the dedicated sections below.</p>
<h3>Open Access in Brill Books<a name="charges"></a></h3>
<p>Brill offers the opportunity to publish individual chapters in Open Access (e.g. for articles in edited volumes). Instead of the regular contributor’s copyright form, chapter authors who would like to publish in Open Access sign a special OA contributor’s license (available from your contact at Brill).</p>
<p>Brill also offers authors the possibility to publish their entire monograph or complete edited volume in Open Access. If you are interested in this option, please get in touch with your <a href="/page/AcquisitionsEditors/acquisitions-editors">acquisitions editor</a> at Brill and indicate this at as early a stage as possible.</p>
<p>For books, the following Book Publication Charges (BPC) apply:<br/>
<img alt="" width="80%" src="/fileasset/downloads_static/static_oaauthors_bpctable.png"/></p>
<p>All prices are excluding VAT.</p>
<h3>Open Access in Brill Journals</h3>
<p>Brill offers authors the option to publish in Open Access in all subscription journals published by Brill and its imprints. If you are interested in publishing your paper in Open Access in one of our journals, please indicate this when submitting through <a href="/page/SubmittingOnline/submitting-online">Editorial Manager</a>, or with your contact at Brill.</p>
<p>For a journal article, the following Article Publication Charges (APC) apply:</p>
<p><strong>Regular article publication charges</strong><br/>
<img alt="" width="80%" src="/fileasset/downloads_static/static_oaauthors_apctable.png"/></p>
<p>All prices are excluding VAT.</p>
<p>Besides subscription journals, Brill also publishes a number of full Open Access journals. For these, the APC will be different from what is mentioned above and in some cases the APC may even be waived entirely. For a full list of all Brill full Open Access journals, including the associated APCs, please see <a href="/page/fulloajournals/full-open-access-journals">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Special article publication charges<br/>
<img alt="" width="80%" src="/fileasset/downloads_static/static_oaauthors_specialapctable.png"/></strong></p>
<p>All prices are excluding VAT.</p>
<h3>Retroactive Open Access Publishing<a name="retroactive"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes funding unexpectedly becomes available when an article, book or chapter has already been published. This is why Brill offers authors the opportunity to make their work available in Open Access retroactively. Adjusted publication charges may apply based on the date of publication. For more information, please contact <a href="mailto:brillopen@brill.com">brillopen@brill.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Open Access Refund Policy</h3>
<p>Brill seeks to publish every open access article, chapter and book on the terms agreed with the authors and without delay. If authors or their institutions are unhappy with any aspect of the open access publishing services, they should get in touch with their contact at Brill or the Brill Open team (<a href="mailto:brillopen@brill.com">brillopen@brill.com</a>).</p>
<p>Article publication charges (APCs) will only be reimbursed if an article does not comply with authors’ funder requirements because of a publisher oversight. APCs will not be refunded where article publication is not compliant with funder mandates for reasons outside Brill’s control. The <a target="_blank" href="http://roarmap.eprints.org/view/policymaker_type/funder.html">Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies</a> maintains a list of policymakers and their mandates.</p>
