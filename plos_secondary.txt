Get Involved! 


Your active participation is vital for progress in Open Access and Open Science. 

Did you know that even now less than 20% of all scientific, technical and medical (STM) 
literature is available via Open Access? 

1. Publish in PLOS (and other Open Access journals) 

In addition to publishing your own work in Open Access* journals, you can encourage 
your colleagues to do the same. If there’s a scientist whose work you find interesting but 
you can’t access, get in touch with them by email, text or phone call to let them know 
you want to read their work. 

*Not all Open Access is the same. Check out <a href="https://www.plos.org/how-open-is-it">HowOpenIsIt?® – the Open Access 
Spectrum guide – to learn more. Browse the <a href="http://www.oaspectrum.org/">Open Access Spectrum Evaluation Tool to 
see the quantitative scores of more than 1,000 journals. 

From proving Open Access as a sustainable publishing model, to providing quality peer-
reviewed scientific literature to the public and creating the world’s largest journal—the 
Public Library of Science (PLOS) is committed to advance science and medicine faster 
by making research more accessible while fostering an engaged scientific community. 


You can help. 

Whether you're an established investigator or an early career researcher, here's how 
you and your colleagues can get involved. 

2. Review for PLOS (and other Open Access journals) 

The success of Open Access relies on dedicated scientists to review the increasing 
number of submissions to Open Access journals. We are always looking for 
knowledgeable individuals to review manuscripts, particularly for PLOS ONE. 

Get started by searching the list of PLOS ONE Academic Editors for those in your field 
of research, then send them a brief summary of your expertise and desire to be a 
reviewer and be sure to sign up for an account in our submission system so your name 
can be searched in the database. 

Learn more about <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/reviewer-guidelines">reviewing for PLOS ONE. 

3. Join the Post-Publication Conversation 

Your active participation in online forums brings new ideas, fresh perspectives and 
constructive critiques to the invaluable discussion of scientific research. Engaging in the 


dialogue can help you and other researchers improve upon work, foster new 
collaborations or inspire new avenues of research. 

• Begin by commenting or asking questions on PLOS articles; it’s easy! Just click 
on the article “Comments” box and sign in to your <a href="https://community.plos.org/registration/new">PLOS account to get started. 
• Participate in the weekly PLOS Science Wednesday on redditscience Ask Me 
Anything featuring PLOS authors; check the <a href="http://plos.io/1Jz2DfN">archive for transcripts. Please note: 
this program is on hiatus beginning 2018 due to changes at reddit that negatively 
impact visibility of AMA content. 
• Comment on The <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/">PLOS Blogs Network simply by entering your name, email and 
comment at the bottom of a post. PLOS BLOGS provide a diverse, high-impact 
venue for sharing ideas and issues pertaining either to a single discipline or the 
broad scientific community. To contribute a single post of commentary or opinion, 
consider the <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/yoursay">Your Say guest blog. 
• Get involved with a PLOS Community – <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/neuro/">PLOS Neuro, <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/synbioo/">PLOS Synbio, <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/ecology/">PLOS 
Ecology, <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/paleocomm/">PLOS Paleo and the upcoming <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/">PLOS ECR Community for Early Career 
Researchers – on <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/">The PLOS Blogs Network. Online communities, managed by 
researchers external to PLOS, provide a forum for you to highlight newly 
published Open Access research, post relevant announcements from other 
organizations and discover new collaborators. 
• Engage with PLOS on <a href="https://twitter.com/plos">Twitter and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PLoS.org/">Facebook. 


4. Let Others Know Your Research Is Open Access 

• Post your articles on your laboratory homepage or personal blog. 
• At research conferences, job interviews or while teaching, note in your slides or 
on your poster that your research article is Open Access and available for 
everyone to read and use, and that your data is also publicly available. 
• When applying for new positions, include relevant <a href="https://www.plos.org/article-level-metrics">Article-Level Metrics 
(ALMs) on your resume or CV along with citation information. ALMs help 
emphasize your research and its usage in the community, rather than 
emphasizing traditional metrics or journal title alone. 



• <a href="https://orcid.org/register">Register for an Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) identifier, a unique 
digital identifier akin to a <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/10/collaboration-improves-recognition-credit/">personal bar code that links you, and only you, to all 
your research work. An ORCID iD travels with you from institution to institution, 
regardless of how your name may be formatted, to ensure that you <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/01/author-credit-plos-orcid-update/">receive 
credit for all your work. Include your iD in your email signature file, CV contact 
information, slide decks and conference posters. PLOS encourages all authors to 
obtain ORCID iDs. 


5. Take Part in Open Access Week 

<a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">International Open Access Week is an opportunity each October for the global 
academic and research community to learn more about the benefits of Open Access, 
share projects and learnings with colleagues and inspire wider participation in making 
Open Access and Open Science the new norms in scholarship and research. 

Each year, the chosen theme resonates with an Open Science ethos—from <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2017/10/open-access-week-2017-open-in-order-to/">Open in 
Order to...in 2017 and <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/10/open-access-week-2016-open-in-action/">Open in Action in 2016 to Open for Collaboration in 2015 and 
Generation Open in 2014. 

Check the <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">website or ask your librarian if there are local or virtual activities of interest. 

6. Join the PLOS Institutional Account Program 

The PLOS <a href="https://www.plos.org/institutional-account-program">Institutional Account Program benefits individual authors and institutions to 
simplify handling of publication charges, also known as Article Processing Charges 
(APCs). <a href="https://www.plos.org/institutional-account-participants">Participating Institutions administer payment for full publication fees for their 
researchers. 

Restrictions from your institution may apply, please review the <a href="https://www.plos.org/institutional-account-participants">Participating 
Institutions list for more information. 

7. Donate 

Support from donors and granting agencies enables PLOS to further its work on 
policies, infrastructures and community building needed to advance Open Access and 
Open Science. Gifts and grants fund innovation and partnerships, integral to the PLOS 
mission as the rapid rise of Open Access research drives the need for online tools to 
harness, process and build on this knowledge. It also goes toward our ability to provide 
fee support for authors around the world who may be unable, or have limited ability, to 
publish in Open Access journals.
