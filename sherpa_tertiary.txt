        <p>The original SHERPA partnership was formed for the SHERPA project (2002-2006) 
          and drew from research-led universities with an active interest in establishing 
          an example of a then-new concept - an open access institutional repository. 
          After a year, the original 7&nbsp;development partners were joined by 
          6&nbsp;more partners to form a partnership of 21 individual institutions. 
          We now have 34 partners and affiliates overall, consisting of 32 HE 
          institutions, the STFC and the British Library.</p>
        <p>SHERPA achieved its original goals ahead of schedule and within budget 
          and has been an active presence on the developing field of institutional 
          repository use. The partnership has now gone on to collaborate in a 
          number of other open access projects.</p>
        <p>The partnership is a large and varied consortium and has within its 
          membership a range of examples of repository environments and institutional 
          structures. The partners are all research-led institutions, all with 
          practical experience of building and populating eprint repositories. 
          As such they are well placed to take full advantage of the facilities 
          that eprint repositories and extended-data repositories can offer. This 
          strong and varied consortial background offers the ideal environment 
          for exploring and testing ideas for repository development, which can 
          be evaluated and disseminated to the wider community.<br>

  <h3><a name="working"></a>Working with SHERPA</h3>
  <p>The SHERPA partner institutions are an existing consortium, with well established 
    managerial support, communications and working practices. As such we are well 
    placed to take advantage of our past work to launch into new areas of repository 
    development. The range of <a href="projects/index.html">projects</a> and issues 
    the partnership is addressing shows the depth of knowledge and experience 
    that is being built. </p>
  <p>The SHERPA partnership is a large, diverse and representative body of institutions. 
    Partner institutions range from smaller specialised bodies such as SOAS, through 
    to large, diverse Universities like Cambridge and Oxford. The partnership 
    includes the British Library and the Arts and Humanities Development Service 
    with their skills and experience in intellectual property rights, data preservation 
    and collection management.</p>
  <p>The partners are all research-led institutions, prominent in the research 
    profile of the UK and are well placed to take full advantage of the facilities 
    that eprint repositories and extended-data repositories can offer. While the 
    majority of institutions use EPrints software, three partners use DSpace for 
    their principle repositories and one uses an in-house system. SHERPA contains 
    two consortial partners, who have different organisational structures. The 
    White Rose Partnership shares a repository, along with joint advocacy, development 
    and presentation. The London LEAP consortium takes advantage of joint technical 
    working but presents seven different repositories to its end users, with individual 
    development paths for the repositories themselves. </p>
  <p>This strong and varied consortial background offers the ideal environment 
    for exploring and testing ideas for repository development. <br>

  <h3><a name="governance"></a> Governance </h3>
  <p>Day to day management of the project overall is by the <a href="contacts.html#manager">SHERPA 
    Partnership Manager</a>, Bill Hubbard, based at the CRC, University of Nottingham. 
    He liaises with other projects, interested institutions, organisations and 
    initiatives. Enquiries and comments on the work of the project should be made 
    to him in the first instance. He is supported by the <A href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/about.html">CRC 
    team</A>. </p>
  <p>SHERPA has two co-Directors, <a href="contacts.html#director">Stephen Pinfield</a> 
    and <a href="contacts.html#director">Caroline Williams</a>, who both oversee 
    the management of the project and ensure adherence to the strategic direction 
    of the SHERPA Managent Group. They also maintain liaison with other interested 
    institutions and scholarly bodies and represent the interests and management 
    of the project at senior inter-institutional levels and within RLUK.</p>
  <p>Work at individual institutions is under the control of Repository Officers.
    Enquiries about project work at specific sites can be 
    made to individual <a href="contacts.html#officer">Repository Officers</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>As part of the formal management structure of SHERPA, a management group 
    for the CRC has been set up to oversee the development of the partnership 
    in the longer term as part of its remit. Membership has been drawn from within 
    the project and the HE community. Contact the <A href="contacts.html#manager">SHERPA 
    Partnership Manage</A>r for more information.</p>
