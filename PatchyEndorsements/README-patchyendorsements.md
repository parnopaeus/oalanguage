# README for Patchy Endorsements Data

## About the Spreadsheets

The Patchy Endorsements spreadsheet contains data for a forthcoming article by Lauren B. Collister and Melissa Cantrell on the use of language in Open Access websites. The source texts are websites, LibGuides, and interview transcripts hosted on the authors' library websites.

- Column 1: Wayback Machine URL - in the event that the websites change
- Column 2: Original URL
- Column 3: Excerpt - this is the excerpt of text picked out by the coder as containing an example of language for the paper
- Column 4: Category - this has 5 coding options from a drop-down menu, these codes were pulled from a literature review on language that contributes to patchy endorsements. The 5 codes are: Word Choice Substitution, Word Choice Order, Hedging, Disclaimer, Complexity
- Column 5: Notes - coder's reasoning or additional information for assigning the code
- Column 6: Coder - initials indicate which author did the coding
- Column 7: Framing - coders added a specific frame (which were referred to as "theme" in the paper) when it was noticeable during coding

Many Excerpts (Column 3) will be repeated because both coders picked out that particular except to note. When an excerpt appears only once, only that coder picked out that excerpt originally, but after consolidation both coders agreed to keep the excerpt in the dataset.
