	<li>As soon as your article has been accepted for publication, send <a href="mailto:lib_oscc@ku.edu">lib_oscc@ku.edu</a> your accepted manuscript and citation.<a href="mailto:kuscholarworks@ku.edu"> </a></li>

<p>If you’re interested, we offer additional support that can help you share more of your work in KU ScholarWorks:</p>

<ol><li>We can read your publication agreement before it is signed to determine whether you are allowed to share your work in KU ScholarWorks.  Just send it to <a href="mailto:lib_oscc@ku.edu">lib_oscc@ku.edu</a> and we’ll review the agreement and reply promptly with our analysis.</li>
	<li>If the publication agreement will not allow you to share your work in KU ScholarWorks, we can provide you with some <a href="http://openaccess.ku.edu/resources">sample text that you can add to the publication agreement </a>to try to reserve the rights to do this.  </li>
	<li>If you want to publish in an Open Access journal, see <a href="#PublishingOA">Publishing in an Open Access Journal</a> to help you determine which Open Access journal is right for you. </li>
	<li>KU has allocated <a href="http://library.kumc.edu/authors-fund.xml">funds for which you can apply to help pay for open access journal article processing fees</a>.<br />

<p>Open Access journals are an up-and-coming phenomena. Like all new innovations, whether economic or technological “consumers” should choose carefully. Below are resources for authors interested in submitting an article to an Open Access scholarly journal, including ways to get help paying fees associated with such publishing.</p>

<p>Please note:  Some traditional closed-access publishers have Open Access (for a fee) options. We call this “hybrid open access” and generally don’t recommend it. These are not truly Open Access journals because only some of the articles are openly available.</p>

<p><em>Choosing the right Open Access journal: </em></p>

<p>We are hearing of authors receiving solicitations from unknown journals and wondering if they are legitimate. Good question!  Here are resources for determining:</p>

<ol><li>Is the journal listed in the <a href="http://www.doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ)?  DOAJ is a directory of Open Access journals that have met some (newly revised and internationally discussed and vetted) standards. </li>
	<li>Is the publisher of the journal a member of the <a href="http://oaspa.org/">Open Access Scholarly Publishing Association</a> (OASPA), an association of publishers of Open Access journals?  OASPA also uses internationally discussed and vetted criteria.</li>
	<li>Does it meet the <a href="http://www.gvsu.edu/library/sc/open-access-journal-quality-indicators-2.htm">Open Access Journal Quality Indicators</a> test?  This resource lists positive and negative indicators that authors can use to determine if the Open Access journal in which they want to publish is legitimate. </li>
	<li>Where does it fall on the <a href="http://www.plos.org/open-access/howopenisit/">"HowOpenIsIt?" Open Access Spectrum</a> guide? This may be used to determine how open a journal's publisher policy really is. </li>
	<li><a href="http://thinkchecksubmit.org/" target="_blank">Think. Check. Submit.</a> is a campaign to help researchers identify trusted journals for their research. It is a simple checklist researchers can use to assess the credentials of a journal or publisher.</li>
</ol><p>KU authors publishing in fully Open Access journals can <a href="http://library.kumc.edu/authors-fund.xml">apply for funds to help pay for article processing fees</a>.</p>
