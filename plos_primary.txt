Benefits of Open Access Journals 


Open Access stands for unrestricted access and unrestricted reuse. 

 

Accelerated Discovery 

With Open Access, researchers can read and build on the findings of others without 
restriction. 

 

Public Enrichment 

Much scientific and medical research is paid for with public funds. Open Access allows 
taxpayers to see the results of their investment. 

 

Improved Education 

Open Access means that teachers and their students have access to the latest research 
findings throughout the world. 

 

Why Open Access Matters 



Most publishers own the rights to the articles in their journals. Anyone who wants to 
read the articles must pay to access them. Anyone who wants to use the articles in 
any way must obtain permission from the publisher and is often required to pay 
an additional fee. 

Although many researchers can access the journals they need via their institution and 
think that access is free, in reality it is not. The institution has often been involved in 
lengthy negotiations around the price of their site license and reuse of this content is 
limited. 

Paying for access to journals makes sense in the world of print publishing, where 
providing articles to each reader requires the production of physical copies of articles, 
but in the online world, with distribution as wide as the internet's reach, it makes 
much less sense. 

How It Works at PLOS 

PLOS applies the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license to works we publish. 
This license was developed to facilitate Open Access—namely, free immediate access 
to, and unrestricted reuse of, original works of all types. Under this license, authors 
agree to make articles legally available for reuse, without permission or fees, for virtually 
any purpose. Anyone may copy, distribute or reuse these articles, as long as the author 
and original source are properly cited. Additionally, the journal platform that PLOS uses 
to publish research articles is <a href="http://www.ambraproject.org/">Open Source. 

Additional Open Access Resources 

There are many other organizations, such as <a href="sparcopen.org">SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and 
Academic Resources Institute) and the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Foundations that work tirelessly 
for progress in Open Access. You can find additional <a href="http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Main_Page">free resources to help you learn 
more or to advocate for Open Access journals at your institution.
