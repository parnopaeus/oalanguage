      "\t\t\t\tThe launch of the internet nearly 30 years ago allowed for the development of the concept of open access. Early open access initiatives included the launch of the&nbsp;online subject repository arXiv&nbsp;in 1991, the publication of several free, peer reviewed online journals in the early 1990s,&nbsp;and the development of the National Institute of Health&#39;s repository PubMedCentral in 2000. Then, in 2002 and 2003, three distinct meetings took place in Budapest, Berlin and Bethesda which gave rise to a formal and still globally accepted definition of &quot;open access.&quot;&nbsp;The widely accepted definition of open access literature is as follows: Open access literature is digital, online free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.1\n",
      "\n",
      "Although costs for digital publishing can be lower than print publications, open access publishing is not free. Instead of charging the reader for access through purchase or subscription, alternative business models have arisen that provide the publishers with the financial means for providing access to scholarship. One cost recovery model is the implementation of article processing charges (APCs). These charges are paid by the author (who may get assistance from research grants, his university, or his library) prior to publication. Production costs can also be offset by the sale of memberships,&nbsp;add-ons and enhanced services by the publisher. In some cases, journals are fully subsidized by a sponsoring institution, funder or other organization without charging authors or readers.&nbsp;However, while open access publishing has the potential to reduce costs, this is not the only driving force behind open access advocacy.

However, many open access journals adhere to the same strict review process as more traditional journals. Peer review is medium-independent, as relevant to online journals as to print journals. It can be carried out in cost effective ways with new supporting software and technologies.\n",
      "\tGreen Open Access is when an author archives a version of their work in an open access repository, irrespective of where it is finally published.&nbsp;After publication, author self-archives a version (peer-reviewed&nbsp;postprint) of the article for free public use in their institutional repository (IR), in a central repository (e.g.,&nbsp;PubMed&nbsp;Central), or on some other open access website.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tDigital repositories are widely used as a mechanism for making scholarly works freely accessible on the web. Academic libraries are often involved in the creation and management of institutional repositories that focus on preserving and disseminating the scholarship produced by their institution&rsquo;s faculty and students. This can include article pre-prints and manuscripts, technical reports, conference proceedings, data sets, and software, as well as theses and dissertations. For many libraries, ETDs (Electronic Theses and Dissertations) are the first targets for an institutional repository program, and represent an opportunity to engage graduate students and their faculty advisors in broader conversation about open access, intellectual property management, long-term management of digital content, and other scholarly communication issues. Institutional repositories are especially important for universities with open access policies that direct faculty to deposit final manuscripts of scholarly articles into repository. &nbsp;They are further useful in helping researchers comply with funder mandates on the accessibility of research data. Libraries are also instrumental in creating repositories for the purpose of digitizing, preserving, and showcasing cultural heritage collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disciplinary repositories, such as arXiv (physics, mathematics, nonlinear sciences, computer science, quantitative biology) perform the same sorts of services as institutional repositories, but for scholars within particular disciplines or groups of disciplines. Finally, grant funding agencies, such as federal agencies, create and maintain their own repositories&nbsp;to preserve and disseminate the research they support. These repositories include not only scholarly articles but also the data produced and compiled in the process of the funded research.&nbsp;\n",

      "WHAT IS GREEN OPEN ACCESS? \n",
      "Green open access is the process of sharing a version of your subscription article online so that the \n",
      "public can read your research. This is often accomplished by linking to your article or by sharing the \n",
      "full-text which is sometimes known as manuscript posting or self-archiving. Linking can be done \n",
      "immediately to the final version of your article, but sharing the full-text of your article requires a bit \n",
      "more time and effort as you need to be mindful of when, where, and how this is done. \n",
      "You are able to link or share full-text, but there are some advantages to linking to your articles: \n",
      "• Maximize Research Impact – citation metrics and altmetrics are used to assess the impact of \n",
      "research, so it is essential that these are aggregated and shared. This is easier when you link to \n",
      "the full text rather than have multiple versions across different platforms. \n",
      "• Best Available Version – It is also important that you share the best available version, so readers \n",
      "can trust they are reading the most up to date, correct and citable version of your work. When \n",
      "linking, this is often done dynamically by publishers sharing their holdings information with \n",
      "both repositories and search engines, so readers will automatically get the best available version. \n",
      "• Article in Context – Another benefit of linking is that readers can benefit from finding other \n",
      "relevant articles, saving them important time in discovering research. This can occur in the \n",
      "context of a repository, where they can see other research from your institution or from the \n",
      "publishing platform. \n",
      "• More Efficient – Linking is also easier for authors as there is no additional step to deposit the \n",
      "full text version. You can continue to promote your research through our share link service. After \n",
      "publication you’ll receive a customized url which provides 50 days free access to your article, so \n",

We can provide gold open access services because the article publishing charge (APC) that authors, their institutions or funding bodies pay, covers all expenses needed to support the publication process. Our APC fees range between c$150 and c$5000 US Dollars excluding tax and specific prices can be found on the individual journal&rsquo;s homepages.Where can you publish?Open access journals: Do not have any subscribers and publish all their articles gold open access. See a list of open access journals published by ElsevierHybrid journals: Support open access and are two journals in one: a subscription journal and an open access journal. After acceptance authors can choose how they wish to publish and broadcast their research.Subsidized journals: Published research is free to read and the APC is subsidized by an organization or society which means authors do not need to directly pay.Complying with policiesWe are also able to help researchers in complying with the policies of their funders and institutions. We have established a number of agreements with organizations such as the Wellcome Trust, Research Councils UK, which help outline the compliant open access options available to researchers. See our list of funding body agreements.LicensesEveryone is able to download, copy and share gold open access articles. We provide authors with a choice of publishing under either the Creative Commons licenses CC-BY or the Creative Commons CC-BY-NC-ND user license.

This means authors do not need to pay any additional charges.When can you share?Millions of researchers have subscriptions to immediately access research on ScienceDirect. To enable open access for a subscription article a time delay, known as an embargo period, is needed. This begins from the date the article is formally published online in its final and fully citable form (i.e. online publication date or the issue publication date).&nbsp;Our embargo periods typically range from 12 &ndash; 24 months and specific embargo periods can be found on the individual journal homepages. Search for an embargo period&nbsp;How can you share?Linking: Sharing a link to the article can be done immediately either via our Share Link service or with the article&rsquo;s permanent address (DOI)Open Archives: Everyone can read and download free archived material in 110 Elsevier journals after an embargo period. See a list of journals with open archives.Self-archiving: Authors can post a copy of their research for everyone to read for free. See our sharing policy for details.New servicesThere are also alternative ways Elsevier is enabling linking to articles. For example, if your funder partners with CHORUS, all readers will be able search for your article and follow a link to ScienceDirect where they can access either the final version of the article or the accepted manuscript.\n",

      "Open access (OA) publishing has emerged as a viable publishing model. In an OA model, all \n",
      "costs associated with the added value provided by publishers are covered up front so there \n",
      "are no subscription costs or access fees for either the institution or the individual researcher. \n",
      "OA publishing delivers content at no cost to the reader and without restrictions, expanding \n",
      "access to literally anyone with an Internet connection and an interest in a given topic. This is \n",
      "an especially salient point for authors of scientific content. \n",
      "OA is no longer a new or experimental model. Over the past ten years, it has matured into one \n",
      "of the standard models with specific benefits for the academic community and it is a model \n",
      "whose growth continues to accelerate. \n",
      "This paper will provide an overview of the OA model and its evolution over the past decade. \n",
      "We will also look at the key benefits for authors of academic content. \n",
      "How does open access work? \n",
      "OA publishing removes barriers to accessing academic content. In a well-designed OA model, \n",
      "all participants benefit. Researchers and authors value the broad access to and visibility of \n",
      "their research. Academic institutions, funders and societies see benefits from research that is \n",
      "freely available, helping them to achieve their mission to develop and disseminate knowledge \n",
      "in a particular field of study. And society as a whole will see positive effects, as researchers and \n",
      "non-researchers alike gain access to high-quality academic scholarship. \n",
      "OA publishing uses two basic models: Green OA (also referred to as self-archiving) and Gold \n",
      "OA. Green OA is the practice of placing the accepted version of an author’s manuscript into a \n",
      "repository, making it freely accessible for everyone.1 \n",
      "Gold OA, which will be the primary focus of this paper, makes the final version of an article \n",
      "freely and permanently accessible for everyone, immediately upon publication. It also \n",
      "removes most of the permission barriers, allowing unlimited re-use and distribution. Gold \n",
      "OA articles can be published either in hybrid journals or in fully OA journals. A hybrid journal \n",
      "is a subscription-based journal that offers an OA option; fully OA journals on the other hand \n",
      "exclusively publish OA content. \n",
      "Gold OA publishing is not without costs and publishers defray these costs through so-called \n",
      "article-processing charges (APCs). APCs are levied after article acceptance, at the beginning \n",
      "of the publication process, and vary depending on the respective publisher, journal and \n",

Under this policy, journals whose subscription content changed by more than 10% when comparing the previous two years had their institutional licence price adjusted. Springer has also been committed to factoring the Open Choice article uptake into journal subscription prices since 2011. Since 2015, Springer journal list prices have solely reflected subscription article publications.

      "    What is Open Access Publishing?\n",
      "A paper published via an open access (OA) route means that that research literature is free-to-view by anyone in the world via the internet and to reuse with attribution under a Creative Commons licence or equivalent.\n",
      "\tThere are three distinct types of open access all of which are available at SAGE:\n",
      "Pure ‘Gold’ Open Access Publishing: Articles are peer reviewed, selected and formally published and then made available with no subscription pay-walls. The full-text of articles are freely available online immediately upon publication. Authors will have agreed to publish work with one of the Creative Commons licences which enable them to retain copyright while allowing others to copy, distribute, and make some uses of their work. Most SAGE pure gold OA journals are supported by the payment of an article processing charge (APC) by the author, institution or research funder of the accepted manuscript. Frequently asked questions are below.\n",
      "SAGE Choice is SAGE's hybrid 'gold' open access offering. This is the practise of making articles published in traditional subscription journals freely available under a more permissive Creative Commons licence for an article processing charge.\n",
      "‘Green’ Open Access Archiving: This relates to the practise of archiving a version of the article somewhere other than the publisher’s website where the final version of the article is hosted. It normally refers to the archiving of the final accepted version of the authors manuscript, with all referees’ comments addressed and revisions made but before it has entered the production process. This is typically archived in an institutional or subject specific repository, on the author’s personal website or on one of the new generation of academic networking sites.\n",

      "Pure Gold Open Access Publication: Frequently Asked Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should I publish open access?\n",
      "What about peer review?\n",
      "Does my librarian need a subscription?\n",
      "Is there a printed version?\n",
      "Who retains copyright?\n",
      "How do I cite an open access article?\n",
      "How do I attribute when re-using content in an open access article? \n",
      "Why is there an Article Processing Charge (APC)?\n",
      "Can an institution pay the article processing charge charge for authors?\n",
      "Is tax included? \n",
      "Are discounts available? \n",
      "What should I do if I cannot pay the OA article processing charge? \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "1. Why should I publish open access?\n",
      "Authors choose open access (OA) publication for a number of reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "It means anyone anywhere in the world can read, use and cite your research, which leads to greater visibility and impact, and may encourage collaborations and faster developments in that field\n",
      "Authors often retain more control over and rights to distribute and re-use of their intellectual property \n",
      "Funders may require outputs for their funded research to be made open access\n",
      "In many countries, much of the research is paid for by the taxpayer, therefore, OA allows the general public to access the research they have contributed towards\n",
      "\n",
      "2. What about peer review?\n",
      "SAGE has been publishing quality journals since 1965. We ensure that the same high standards of rigorous peer review are employed on its OA journals as are used on its subscription journals. This is upheld by the journals’ editors. Journals are members of Committee on Publishing Ethics. Each journal will have a peer review policy clearly outlined in its Submission Guidelines.\n",
      "3. Does my librarian need a subscription?\n",
      "\tOA articles are free to anyone (individuals, libraries and institutions) with internet access. Therefore, a subscription is unnecessary to access and re-use articles. Individuals can register to receive email alerts for all OA journals.\n",
      "4. Is there a printed version?\n",
      "\tGenerally, pure gold OA journals are entirely online with no printed edition of any published articles. However, reprints are available, if requested.\n",
      "5. Who retains copyright?\n",
      "\tAuthors retain copyright under the terms outlined by the Creative Commons licences while allowing others to copy, distribute, and make some uses of their work – at least non-commercially. Every Creative Commons licence also ensures authors get the credit for their work. The licences work around the world and lasts as long as applicable copyright lasts. Most SAGE pure gold OA journals will offer a selection of these licences, usually, with one default licence. Please check the individual journal licence policy.\n",
      "6. How do I cite an open access article?\n",
      "\tEach OA manuscript is citeable using the date of the manuscript's first online posting and the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). DOIs are assigned to all SAGE content for use on digital networks; and the metadata associated with that content is registered with the DOI Foundation. DOIs provide a consistent, permanent way to identify manuscripts published in the online environment. Some OA journals will still publish ‘issues’ so information such as volume, issue, and page numbers will still be allocated to articles. With continuous publication, where there is no issue or page number, manuscripts should be cited as follows: \n",

      "8. Why is there an Article Processing Charge (APC)?\n",
      "\tAlthough the publication is OA, there are costs at every stage of the publication process, including but not limited to running peer-review systems, copyediting and typesetting, hosting the article in perpetuity on dedicated servers and marketing. APCs vary from journal to journal, and discounts may be available. Most SAGE OA journals are supported by APCs.\n",
      "9. Can an institution pay the article processing charge for authors?\n",
      "\tIt is ultimately the responsibility of the author(s) to arrange payment of the open access article processing charge. However, a number of institutions and funding organizations (e.g., the Wellcome Trust) have declared their willingness to make additional funds available to cover the costs of open access publication.\n",

      "12. What should I do if I cannot pay the OA article processing charge? \n",
      "\tYou could consider publishing in any SAGE subscription journal, then under SAGE’s open access archiving policy you can deposit your article in your own institution’s repository immediately at no charge. However, if you wish to publish in a pure gold open access journal, but you genuinely cannot afford the article processing charge (APC) and have no funding from your funder or institution, you should submit a waiver request to the journal when payment is required. Your ability to pay will not affect the editorial peer review outcome. Requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and priority for partial and full waivers will be given to authors who reside in the countries described by the Research4Life programme. See which OA journals are included in our SAGE waiver scheme. Waiver requests are assessed and granted by SAGE, not the Editor or editorial board, to ensure editorial independence.\n",

This enables us to better develop appropriate strategies that both protect our existing core business and capitalize on new market developments.\n",
      "Open access is fundamentally driven by the technological advances we have seen over the last two decades and provides many opportunities. We believe that the best way to assess what impact it will have is to engage and experiment.\n",

Open access articles should be made available using some form of  Creative Commons (CC) License. The licensing landscape is complex: some believe that only material released under a CC BY or CC(0) is true open access as it places the minimum of restrictions on re-use. SAGE believes that it should not enforce one particular CC license on our authors; rather we should enable author choice. Please view our open access license options.\n",
      " The SAGE Gold Open Access Story\n",
      "SAGE has been experimenting with Gold open access for many years. Key early initiatives were:\n",
      "\n",
      "2007 - SAGE-Hindawi\n",
      "\n",
      "SAGE entered into a partnership with Hindawi Publishing Corporation in 2007. This combined Hindawi’s experience of open access and its custom build OA workflow with SAGE’s editorial expertise. Through this we gained some early hands on experience of launching and managing pure OA journals. The partnership was dissolved in 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "2008 - SOAP Project and OASPA\n",
      "\n",
      "SAGE was one of only two publishing partners to engage in the EC funded FP7 framework project the Study of Open Access Publishing. This study analyzed the 2008 OA market and questioned over a million academics worldwide to assess their attitude towards OA. With over 35,000 responses this exercise provided valuable detail on the expectations and attitude of the academic market.\n",
      "SAGE was a founding board member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association in 2008. David Ross, our Global Head of Open Access, was integral in drafting the OA publishing trade association’s constitution and best practice guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "2010 - SAGE Open\n",
      "\n",
      "In late 2010 SAGE launched the first broad spectrum OA journal aimed specifically at the Social and Behavioral Sciences, SAGE Open. While OA publishing had by then become established in the Biomedical and Life Sciences it had yet to gain any real traction in HSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) mainly because of different funding structures. OA in biomedicine has partly been driven by the funding bodies themselves and research grants are typically orders of magnitude bigger than in HSS. However, SAGE believes that there was a demand and so created SAGE Open to provide service to our authors and enable experimentation. SAGE Open published its 1000th paper in early 2015 providing clear proof of concept that there is a real appetite amongst the HSS community for OA Publishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2015 and Beyond\n",
      "\n",
      "Our success with SAGE Open and our experience with some acquisition gave us the confidence to pursue a more aggressive strategy. By the end of 2014 we were publishing 40 OA titles and we will continue to launch more over the coming years to ensure we continue to provide a comprehensive service to all our authors.\n",
      "SAGE Policies\n",
      "Maintaining Quality\n",
      "\tSAGE has a reputation for quality publishing in every discipline and market it operates in and under no circumstances will it compromise this. It is acknowledged that there are some concerns regarding the perceived conflict of interest of author-pays publishing but we believe that there is no reason that OA journals cannot be held to the same standards as any other traditional subscription journal. We ensure all the journals we publish meet our own exacting standards and that there are enough checks and balances in place to negate these. Peer review should be held to the same high standards in all journals, regardless of the business model they operate under.\n",
      "Relationship to Existing Business\n",
      "\tWe believe that OA journals will complement our existing traditional business, augmenting it by providing an alternative route to publication to those authors that are interested in an open access option. Published global research output is growing at approximately 3% per annum on approximately two million articles a year. Author-pays open access publishing provides an outlet for this additional material.\n",
      "Double Dipping/Subscription OffsettingThere are obviously consequences for subscriber expectations if a large amount of material in a journal is made available free of charge. Please see SAGE’s statement regarding this issue.\n",
      "SAGE Choice\n",
      "Another version of paid-for Gold open access is Hybrid Gold open access. Under this model the author of a paper published in a subscription journal can elect to pay a fee to enable the article to be made available openly. This option has been driven mainly by funding agencies in the biomedical/life sciences (most notably the Wellcome Trust) who have explicitly made funds available for this. At SAGE this mode of publication is called SAGE Choice.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\tIOP Publishing is a strong supporter of open science and open access to scientific research. A pioneer in open access publishing in physics, we launched the first fully open access journal in physics, New Journal of Physics, with the Institute of Physics and the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in 1998. Since then, we have launched several new fully open access journals. In addition, we have introduced open access publishing options for authors in our conventional subscription journals. Click here for a full list of all of IOP Publishing’s open access options.\n",
      "Open access licences\n",
      "By default, we publish all open access articles under a Creative Commons CC BY 3.0 licence, which allows the widest possible sharing of research, while ensuring full attribution for authors.\n",
      "Managing the costs of open access\n",
      "IOP Publishing has also been at the forefront in developing ways for libraries and funders to manage the costs of open access publishing. Offsetting arrangements have been established in several countries. These arrangements enable institutions to offset their open access costs against their subscription costs. IOP Publishing operates a transparent mechanism to reduce subscription prices to compensate for growth in open access revenues. We also offer institutional membership schemes to reduce the costs of publishing in our fully gold open access journals.\n",
      "Supporting the infrastructure of open access\n",
      "IOP Publishing is a member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association and a sponsor and member of the Directory of Open Access Journals.\n",

      "Gold Open Access is an alternative to subscriptions and other access payments. Content is published under a Creative Commons licence that allows free access and redistribution and, in many cases, allows re-use in new or derivative works. Typically, but not always, Gold OA content is supported by an Article Processing Charge (APC) paid by the author or their funder. We also publish Gold OA content that is supported by other financial models, particularly in humanities and social sciences.\n",

      " Find out more about our OA journals Find out more about our OA booksFind out more about our OA Elements \n",

      "Green Open Access (also known as Green archiving)&nbsp;is the practice of making a version of a work freely accessible in an institutional or subject archive or some other document repository. Typically the author’s original (submitted) manuscript is made available, or the manuscript as it was accepted for publication after peer-review changes have been made. For some types of books, a portion of the final published version can also be made available\n",
      "Social sharing is similar to Green OA except that documents are typically shared in a commercial sharing site or scholarly collaboration network site, rather than an institutional repository. See our social sharing page for more information. Our Green OA policies include provisions for social sharing and Cambridge Core Share also provides a means for sharing&nbsp;the published versions of journal articles.&nbsp; \n",

      "﻿1. What is Open Access?\n",
      "\n",
      "Open Access is a publication model whereby a manuscript is made freely available in some format, in some cases with liberal permission for reuse and redistribution. There is a common distinction between two models of Open Access: Green and Gold. Green Open Access enables the accepted manuscript to be made freely available via an online repository period following an embargo period (also referred to as self-archiving). Gold Open Access enables the version of record to be made freely available on publication with additional usage rights. All journal articles are published under a Green Open Access model by default, whilst the choice of Gold Open Access is made available to authors upon acceptance, usually in return for the payment of an Article Processing Charge (APC).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. How do I make my article Open Access?\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon acceptance of your article for publication in the journal you will receive an email in which you will be provided with the option to proceed under the default Green Open Access publishing model or to publish your article under the Gold Open Access model, which will require payment of the APC.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Can I convert articles that I have already published in the journal under the subscription model to Open Access?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, this option is available to you. If you would like to make articles that you have already published in the journal Open Access then please contact the Editorial office.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Are Open Access articles treated differently from those submitted under the subscription model during the submission process?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. All manuscripts will be peer reviewed and processed to the same high standard. Only after acceptance will you be given the option to express your wish to publish Open Access. Publishing your manuscript under Open Access terms will not affect the outcome of the peer review process.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. How will readers know that articles are available via Open Access?\n",
      "\n",
      "Each Open Access article is clearly labelled with an Open Access symbol in the online table of contents for each issue of the journal. On the journal website readers can also navigate to a list of Open Access articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. If I publish under Green Open Access what is the embargo period?\n",
      "\n",
      "The embargo period for all CUP STM journals is 6 months. This is the period from the publication of an article until the accepted manuscript may be made available through a public repository. There is no embargo period for HSS STM journals. For further information please see our Green open access policy for journals.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. In which kind of repository am I permitted to deposit my work and which version of the manuscript should I deposit?\n",

      "\n",
      "8. What is the Article Processing Charge (APC)?\n",
      "\n",
      "The APC is the fee that an author needs to pay in order for their article to be published under the gold open access model in the journal. This fee covers costs such as copyediting, typesetting and online hosting. Download our full list of APC charges.\n",
      "9. How do I pay the APC?\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have indicated that you would like your article to be published under the gold Open Access model you will be contacted by CCC-RightsLink who are acting on our behalf to collect the APC. Please follow their instructions in order to avoid any delay in the publication of your article.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. If I pay the APC when will my article become freely available?\n",
      "\n",
      "The version of record (the final PDF version of the manuscript) will become freely available as soon as it is published online.\n",
      "12. Can my APC be refunded?We do refund APCs if we have not met our promises to you. See our APC refund policy for more information about this and how to request a refund.\n",
      "13. If I pay the APC which version of my article will be made freely available?\n",

      "“accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”The number of authors choosing to publish open access has surged in recent years, seeing it as an opportunity to broaden the impact of their work. Many funders and institutions now also require open access publication of research. However, there is still much variation in the uptake of open access between geographical regions and areas of academic study.\n",
      "Taylor &amp; Francis is one of the world’s largest publishers of open access research. If you choose to publish with us, there is a wide range of open access options available to you. This means you can comply with any funder requirements and ensure your research makes a difference.\n",
      "Open access and reuse rights\n",
      "Open access isn’t just about others being able to read your research without barriers. OA also gives researchers greater opportunity to build upon the work of others. Most OA articles have a Creative Commons license which explains how others can use them. In some cases, it may give complete freedom to reuse and repurpose the published work. Regardless, it’s always necessary to acknowledge the original author.\n",
      "At Taylor &amp; Francis, we offer a range of Creative Commons licensing options, so you can find the right fit for your research. See our guide to copyright licenses for more information.\n",
      "What is open research?You may also have heard the term ‘open research’. Open access is one part of this larger drive for more openness in scholarly communication. Open research, also called ‘open science’ or ‘open scholarship’, looks beyond the peer-reviewed journal article or book. There are many other outputs of the research cycle that are useful for fellow academics who want to understand and build upon your work. This can include research data, code, and lab notes.

      "\n",
      "A guide to sharing different versions of your article\n",
      "The National Information Standards Organization, in partnership with the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers, has defined the following versions:\n",
      "Version of Record (VoR)“A fixed version of a journal article that has been made available by … a publisher by formally and exclusively declaring the article ‘published’.”\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "This is the final, definitive, citable version of your paper. It has been copy-edited, typeset, had metadata applied, and has been allocated a DOI. This is the version published on Taylor &amp; Francis Online.\n",
      "The VoR includes any “early release” article that is formally identified as being published even before the compilation of a volume issue and assignment of associated metadata, as long as it is citable via some permanent identifier(s).\n",
      "How can I share it?\n",
      "If you have chosen to publish your article gold open access, you can share this final version however you wish. This includes depositing it in repositories and sharing it online.\n",
      "Please do not share a PDF of the VoR if you have not published your article gold open access. Instead, you will need to use either your Author’s Original Manuscript (AOM) or Accepted Manuscript (AM). We recommend that you include a link to the VoR from anywhere you post an earlier version of your article.\n",
      "Accepted Manuscript (AM)“The version of a journal article that has been accepted for publication in a journal.”\n",
      "What is it? \n",
      "This version is your paper after peer review, when it has been revised and accepted for publication by the journal editor. When you receive the acceptance email from the Editorial Office, keep a copy of your AM for any future posting.\n",
      "How can I share it?\n",
      "As a Taylor &amp; Francis author, you can post your AM on your personal website any time after publication. This includes posting to Facebook, Google groups, and LinkedIn, plus linking from Twitter.\n",
      "Embargoes apply if you are posting the AM to an institutional or subject repository, or to a scholarly collaboration network such as ResearchGate, Mendeley, or Academia.edu. The open access options finder lists the embargo periods for all Taylor &amp; Francis and Routledge journals.\n",
      "To encourage citation of your work (and to be able to monitor and understand who is reading it using article metrics), we recommend that you insert a link from your posted AM to the published article on Taylor &amp; Francis Online with the following text:\n",
      "“This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor &amp; Francis in [Journal Title] on [Date of Publication], available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/[Article DOI].”\n",
      "Author’s Original Manuscript (AOM)“Any version of a journal article that is considered by the author to be of sufficient quality to be submitted for formal peer review.”\n",
      "What is it? \n",
      "The AOM is your original manuscript (sometimes called a “preprint”) before you submitted it to a journal for peer review.\n",
      "How can I share it?\n",
      "You can share this as much as you like. If you post it anywhere, including on a scholarly collaboration network, we recommend you use an amended version of the wording below. This will encourage usage and citation of your final, published article (the VoR):\n",
      "“This is the Author’s Original Manuscript of an article published by Taylor &amp; Francis in [Journal Title] on [Date of Publication], available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/[Article DOI].”\n",
      "Institutional repositoriesA repository is a digital platform used to host and preserve scholarly outputs. If you’re based at a research institution, you’re probably required to place a version of your article in their repository. If your article has been published gold open access in a Taylor &amp; Francis journal you can deposit a PDF of the VoR in the repository as soon as it’s published.\n",
      "However, if you choose not to publish gold open access then you’ll need to archive a copy of the AOM or the AM. For most Taylor &amp; Francis journals there is an embargo period during which the AM should be a closed deposit.\n",
      "What’s a “closed deposit”?\n",
      "This is when you post your AM to your institutional repository so that it’s available for those within your institutional network to access. You (or repository staff) can make this an open deposit after the relevant embargo period has passed. AMs can be posted at any point to repositories as closed deposits.\n",
      "What’s an “open deposit”?\n",
      "This is when you post your AM to your institutional repository so it’s freely available for anyone to access. All authors should respect embargo periods before making AMs available as an open deposit. You can check the embargo period on all journals in the open access options finder.\n",

      "“accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”The number of authors choosing to publish open access has surged in recent years, seeing it as an opportunity to broaden the impact of their work. Many funders and institutions now also require open access publication of research. However, there is still much variation in the uptake of open access between geographical regions and areas of academic study.\n",
      "Taylor &amp; Francis is one of the world’s largest publishers of open access research. If you choose to publish with us, there is a wide range of open access options available to you. This means you can comply with any funder requirements and ensure your research makes a difference.\n",
      "Open access and reuse rights\n",
      "Open access isn’t just about others being able to read your research without barriers. OA also gives researchers greater opportunity to build upon the work of others. Most OA articles have a Creative Commons license which explains how others can use them. In some cases, it may give complete freedom to reuse and repurpose the published work. Regardless, it’s always necessary to acknowledge the original author.\n",
      "At Taylor &amp; Francis, we offer a range of Creative Commons licensing options, so you can find the right fit for your research. See our guide to copyright licenses for more information.\n",
      "What is open research?You may also have heard the term ‘open research’. Open access is one part of this larger drive for more openness in scholarly communication. Open research, also called ‘open science’ or ‘open scholarship’, looks beyond the peer-reviewed journal article or book. There are many other outputs of the research cycle that are useful for fellow academics who want to understand and build upon your work. This can include research data, code, and lab notes.

      "What is it?\n",
      "This is the final, definitive, citable version of your paper. It has been copy-edited, typeset, had metadata applied, and has been allocated a DOI. This is the version published on Taylor &amp; Francis Online.\n",
      "The VoR includes any “early release” article that is formally identified as being published even before the compilation of a volume issue and assignment of associated metadata, as long as it is citable via some permanent identifier(s).\n",
      "How can I share it?\n",
      "If you have chosen to publish your article gold open access, you can share this final version however you wish. This includes depositing it in repositories and sharing it online.\n",

Instead, you will need to use either your Author’s Original Manuscript (AOM) or Accepted Manuscript (AM). We recommend that you include a link to the VoR from anywhere you post an earlier version of your article.\n",
      "Accepted Manuscript (AM)“The version of a journal article that has been accepted for publication in a journal.”\n",

      "How can I share it?\n",
      "As a Taylor &amp; Francis author, you can post your AM on your personal website any time after publication. This includes posting to Facebook, Google groups, and LinkedIn, plus linking from Twitter.\n",
      "Embargoes apply if you are posting the AM to an institutional or subject repository, or to a scholarly collaboration network such as ResearchGate, Mendeley, or Academia.edu. The open access options finder lists the embargo periods for all Taylor &amp; Francis and Routledge journals.\n",
      "To encourage citation of your work (and to be able to monitor and understand who is reading it using article metrics), we recommend that you insert a link from your posted AM to the published article on Taylor &amp; Francis Online with the following text:\n",

If your article has been published gold open access in a Taylor &amp; Francis journal you can deposit a PDF of the VoR in the repository as soon as it’s published.\n",

      "This is when you post your AM to your institutional repository so that it’s available for those within your institutional network to access.

      "At Taylor &amp; Francis we want to bring these outputs to the surface. Visibility will enrich the reading experience and means that results can be verified and reproduced. Open research also ensures that researchers are given credit for all their valuable work.\n",
      "Here are some of the ways Taylor &amp; Francis is supporting the open research goals of our authors:\n",
      "Data setsIt is increasingly common for researchers to make their research data open. In fact, some funders are now making data sharing a requirement.\n",
      "Sharing data publicly improves the robustness of the research process. It supports validation, research transparency, reproducibility and replicability of results. Depositing data in a repository mints a permanent identifier, such as a DOI. This allows authors and others to cite the data set and researchers to get appropriate credit for their work.\n",
      "For more details about the benefits of data sharing and the requirements of Taylor &amp; Francis journals, read our guide to data sharing.\n",
      "CodeWe’re partnering with Code Ocean to help take Taylor &amp; Francis articles to the next level. We’re aiming to improve the openness and transparency of the underlying code and data associated with articles.\n",
      "Code Ocean allows readers to access code and data directly within an article. They can also run everything in the cloud, without downloading anything to their local computers. Find out more.\n",
      "CitationsTaylor &amp; Francis is part of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC), a collaboration between publishers, researchers, and organizations. Its aim is to promote access to data on citations that is structured, separable and open.\n",
      "Open Science Badges\n",
      "Researchers submitting to journals that support this Center for Open Science (COS) initiative have the opportunity to apply for one or more of the Open Science Badges during submission. If accepted, the badge(s) will be displayed within the html and pdf versions of your article on Taylor &amp; Francis Online.\n",
      "The Badges program was designed by the COS to acknowledge open science practices. They are offered as incentives for researchers to share data, materials, or to preregister, and are a signal to the reader that the content of the study has been made available in perpetuity.\n",
      "Open research podcast episodeTo find out more about what open research is and how it can benefit you and your work, listen to our podcast episode, ‘Making your research open’. With contributions from open research experts, we examine the different ways scholarly outputs can be made open and the support that&#8217;s available for researchers to do this.\n",

      "\n",
      "What is open access? \n",
      "Open access (OA) is the practice of providing unrestricted access to, and re-use of, journal articles. This is different to free access because of the implications for re-use.\n",
      "There are fundamentally two forms of OA: 'green' and 'gold'.\n",
      "Green open access is used to describe the situation when a manuscript is published in a journal and then a version of that paper (usually the refereed, but un-copyedited version) is posted into an institutional or subject repository after a certain period. The exact timeframe varies from journal to journal, but the standard for OUP journals is 12 months in medicine and science and 24 months in other areas.\n",
      "Gold open access, also known as &lsquo;Author Pays&rsquo;, enables the author or their funding body to pay a publication fee to make their article freely accessible immediately upon publication.\n",
      "OUP supports both gold and green open access\n",
      "What is Oxford Open? \n",
      "The Oxford Open initiative is OUP's open access programme. It includes full and optional open access to more than 250 journals drawn from every subject area.\n",
      "How will readers know which articles are available via open access? \n",
      "Articles will be clearly labelled as open access on the online table of contents page. Any users of the electronic table of contents (eTOCs) will therefore be notified when an open access article is published in the Oxford Open initiative.\n",
      "Which journals are currently participating in the Oxford Open initiative? \n",
      "The majority of our journals offer the optional open access option. Please visit the individual journal homepages to see whether they are included in the Oxford Open initiative.\n",
      "When will I be given the choice to pay a publication charge that will enable my paper to be freely available online? \n",
      "Upon acceptance of your paper you will be required to sign a licence to publish online. As part of this process you will be be asked to indicate whether you would like to take the Oxford Open option and pay for open access for your paper.\n",
      "Can I make my article open access after it has already been published under subscription control? \n",
      "If the journal is participating in Oxford Open, please email the open access team and we can arrange this for you.\n",
      "What is the open access publication charge? \n",
      "Open access publication charges vary by journal, and are between &pound;1000-2500. Please see the Instructions to Authors pages of individual journals to find out the applicable charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discounted rates apply to authors in developing countries. Visit our Developing Countries pages for a list of qualifying countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The optional open access charges are in addition to any normal (excess) page charges and colour charges that might apply.\n",
      "How do I pay? \n",
      "If you select an Oxford Open licence to publish, you will be invited to pay online after signing the licence. Oxford Journals Author Services allows you to pay online using a credit or debit card, or to request an invoice by email or post.\n",
      "Will there be colour figure charges or additional page charges if my paper exceeds a certain length?\n",
      "This will depend on the individual journal concerned - please check the 'Instructions to Authors' page for the relevant title. The optional open access charges are in addition to any normal (excess) page and colour charges, and so these charges will continue to apply where they are in place.\n",
      "How will you ensure that the payment for publication charges by authors has no influence on whether an article is accepted for publication in an Oxford Open journal? \n",
      "All manuscripts submitted to journals participating in the Oxford Open initiative will continue to be subject to the same rigorous process of editorial consideration and peer review, thereby ensuring that the high standards the community has come to expect from the journal are maintained. Under the Oxford Open model, the editors of the journal will not be involved in correspondence with authors regarding payment of open access charges for their article. Instead, the author charge system will be administered by the publisher, OUP, only after manuscripts have been accepted for publication. In this way authors should be reassured that their ability to pay publication charges will not influence editorial decisions.\n",
      "Does Oxford University Press double-dip? \n",
      "No. &lsquo;Double dipping&rsquo; describes a situation unique to hybrid open access journals in which a publisher charges authors APCs and then does not reduce the subsequent subscription price of the journal. OUP categorically opposes double dipping and we have discounted our online subscription prices in line with open access uptake since we started publishing hybrid open access journals in 2005. We believe that our customers should not be asked to pay twice for the same content.\n",
      "Journal subscription pricing is dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to changes in page extent and frequency, inflationary pressure, changing costs, competitive position, etc. It&rsquo;s important to note that this means open access discount on prices may not always lead to an absolute price decrease.\n",
      "Will you deposit my article in PubMed Central (PMC)?\n",
      "Upon publication in an issue, all Oxford Open papers will be automatically deposited in PMC by OUP, where subject relevant. The journals participating in this automated process have been determined by PMC, based on subject area.\n",
      "\n",
      "All NIH-funded papers will also be deposited automatically in PMC at issue stage. For more information on how OUP helps authors comply with funding body requirements, including NIH, the Wellcome Trust and HHMI, see our funding agencies page.\n",
      "How does Oxford Open help authors comply with funder mandates? \n",
      "A growing number of funding bodies have mandates in place stipulating that research which they have funded must be made open access. This may be either by mandating deposit in repositories after an embargo period (Green open access) or by requiring that research is published in open access journals (Gold open access).\n",
      "\n",
      "Oxford Open journals give authors the option of making their article open access immediately via the Oxford Journals website. In addition, where subject relevant these open access articles will be automatically deposited and made publically available in PMC upon issue publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, most Oxford Journals have either a 12 month embargo (STM journals) or 24 months (HSS journals), so even if you decide not to pay for immediate open access you will be able to immediately deposit the Accepted Manuscript version of your article in an institutional or non-commercial subject repository, on the proviso that it is not made publically available until after the embargo period.\n",
      "\n",
      "For further details on journal embargo period, please see our Accepted Manuscript embargo periods page, or visit the &lsquo;Self-Archiving Policy&rsquo; page of individual journals to find out the applicable embargo period and which version of the manuscript you are permitted to deposit.\n",
      "\n",
      "These mechanisms allow authors to fulfil open access funding mandates. For more information on how to comply, please click here.\n",
      "Which open access licences does Oxford Open offer? \n",
      "OUP's Oxford Open  journals offer authors a variety of different Creative Commons licences. Some of our journals offer a single Creative Commons licence, while others may offer a choice of two or three. Licencing options vary by discipline and are tailored to be most appropriate for the individial journal. Please check the 'Instructions to Authors' page of any journal to find out which licences the journal offers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three Creative Commons licences which Oxford Open employs are the Creative Commons Attribution licence (CC-BY), the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial licence (CC-BY-NC) and the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives licence (CC-BY-NC-ND).\n",
      "\n",
      "Please click here for more information about these Creative Commons licences.\n",
      "Why do some Oxford Open medical journals charge a higher publication charge for use of the CC-BY licence? \n",
      "The Creative Commons Attribution licence (CC-BY) is the most liberal of the Creative Commons licences and allows for unrestricted reuse, even commercial, as long as the author is credited for their original creation. As some of our medical journals receive a significant proportion of their revenue from pharmacological re-prints, CC-BY is potentially damaging to this important revenue stream. Many of our medical journals are owned by learned societies who use journal revenue to support their altruistic activities, and consequently this potential lost revenue is a concern. As such, the increased cost for CC-BY is in place to help mitigate the financial risks while still facilitating author choice and compliance with funder mandates.\n",

      "A proven track record of success\n",
      "OUP has been publishing OA content since 2004. Since that time, &lsquo;gold&rsquo; OA has grown dramatically and proven effective\n",

      "We have also successfully launched or taken over high-quality OA titles, including: Genome\n",
      "Biology and Evolution, Journal of Legal Analysis, Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics, and Database.\n",
      "OUP facilitates green OA either by allowing authors to deposit versions of their manuscripts in institutional or subject\n",
      "repositories after a specified time period, or depositing the version of record on their behalf.\n",
      "Supporting the evolution of Open Access publishing\n",
      "Sustainable, high-quality OA publishing requires either funding to be available to pay for Article Processing Charges,\n",
      "sponsorship, or suitable embargo periods. This limits which journals, disciplines, and fields can shift to OA, a process that\n",

We believe that open access (OA) can add value to the scholarly publishing process by maximising discoverability and distribution of research materials online through a clear framework for reuse. We have a proven track record in this area; our journals programme, Oxford Open recently celebrated a successful decade of quality, sustainable OA publishing. The majority of our journals now offer authors both green and gold OA options, and a range of licence types, to make their research freely available. \n",

We have taken an active role in discussions around the changing nature of the monograph in the context of digital advancements and evolving publication models. We are currently participating in a number of studies and consortium projects. These will allow us a greater understanding of the opportunities open access publishing offers our monograph authors and will help inform our own publication models. \n",

Under Creative Commons, authors retain copyright of their work. Authors publishing via the open access route in journals on the nature.com platform additionally assign Springer Nature a non-exclusive licence to publish (LTP).\n",
      "All Springer Nature-owned journals with open access options offer the CC BY licence (Creative Commons Attribution v4.0 International Licence), and this is the default licence for all Springer Nature-owned fully open access journals and for OA content in all journals in the Palgrave Macmillan hybrid portfolio, and in the majority of hybrid academic titles on the nature.com platform. The CC BY licence is the most open licence available and considered the industry 'gold standard' for open access; it is also preferred by many funders. This licence allows readers to copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format, and to alter, transform, or build upon the material, including for commercial use, providing the original author is credited. Other Creative Commons licences are available for some titles: please see the individual journals for details on other Creative Commons licences offered.\n",
      "All Springer Nature-owned journals offer intergovernmental organisation (IGO) versions of Creative Commons licences on request, where required by the author’s employer.\n",

      "Authors wishing to change the licence of their article retrospectively should contact the individual journal editorial office, and will need to sign a new open access licence to publish form (LTP). A small number of hybrid academic titles on nature.com charge different article processing charges according to the licence chosen, and in some cases a top-up fee may apply.\n",
      "Authors may change the Creative Commons licence of their article at any time after publication.\n",
      "Retrospective open access\n",
      "Authors who initially opted to publish their paper under the subscription model in a hybrid nature.com or Palgrave Macmillan journal may retrospectively pay to make their paper open access, but only if they do so before the end of March 31st in the year after the publication date. This limitation has been put in place because institutional licence prices for hybrid academic journals reflect the amount of subscription content, and those prices are set soon after the end of Q1. Please see institutional licence price adjustments for hybrid journals for more information about prices and adjustments.\n",
      "Authors wishing to publish open access retrospectively should contact the individual journal editorial office, and will need to sign a new open access licence to publish form (LTP) and pay the journal's article processing charge.

Under this policy, journals whose subscription content changed by more than 10% when comparing the previous two years had their institutional licence price adjusted.\n",
      "Springer has also been committed to factoring the Open Choice article uptake into journal subscription prices since 2011. Since 2015, Springer journal list prices have solely reflected subscription article publications.

This means that only subscription articles have been factored into the 2018 list price calculations: the OA share of the most recent year (2016) for which we had full data when the 2018 prices were calculated has been applied.

      "Visibility: With Open Access, your work is freely  available to as broad an audience as possible. It boosts downloads and  citations. You are also free to share it wherever you like. Increase  usage and impact of your research by sharing your work in institutional  and commercial repositories such as academia.edu, researchgate.net or mendeley.com.\n",
      "Compliance: More and more research councils, funding  bodies and institutions have a mandate in place requiring you to  publish in Open Access. Brill aims to be compliant with all  institutional policies, and is fully compliant with the policy of  national and European funders such as the RCUK and ERC; as well as with  the policy of independent organizations such as the Wellcome Trust. An  exhaustive and up to date overview of all Open Access mandates and  policies can be found via ROARMAP.\n",
      "Quality and Speed: All of Brill’s manuscripts are  peer reviewed, often double-blind, by expert reviewers. Solid quality  control is Brill’s top priority for its entire publishing program,  including our Open Access publications. Our in-house editors will  support and advise you during the publication process. We aim to work to  strict deadlines in order to have your book or article published and  brought to market as soon as possible. Almost all Brill Open  publications are also published in print.\n",
      "Sales and Marketing: Our dedicated sales and  marketing team works with all relevant academic, corporate and  government libraries around the world, thus assuring the widest possible  exposure.\n",
      "Open Access for books: If you choose to participate  in our Open Book program, your book will be made available  electronically in Open Access immediately upon publication. This means  no embargo will be applicable. The OA version will be listed in the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) and the OAPEN library.  The OA version is distributed to libraries in the same way as a regular  e-book, meaning that your library can subscribe to receive the metadata  so that you can find it in the catalogue.\n",
      "Hybrid and full OA for journals: Brill publishes  more than 270 journals covering a wide variety of disciplines in the  humanities, international law and social sciences.

      "﻿What is Open Access Publishing?\"By 'open access' to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.\"The Budapest Open Access Initiative »Hindawi publishes all of our journals using a Gold Open Access model. All articles published in Hindawi journals are available to readers completely free of charge. Access is made possible by a fee for publication that is paid at the time of article acceptance, usually by an author’s institution or funder. Articles become available immediately upon publication, and a visitor to Hindawi.com can immediately access, download, print, and read any published article in its entirety. Author(s) retain copyright of their work, but readers are free to reuse the material (providing proper citations are given), as all Hindawi articles are published under the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY).Open Access is a reaction to the traditional, subscription-based model of scholarly publishing. Under the subscription system, anyone wishing to read an article has to pay a fee to the publisher. At an institutional level this is usually arranged by the library, which agrees to pay the publisher in order for its members to have access to relevant journals. Subscriptions originally would have involved the physical delivery of printed copies of the journal, but today’s publishers have almost entirely adopted digital delivery. More recently, subscriptions have involved bulk journal packages with large publishers, commonly referred to as ‘big deals’.When institutional access is not available, individual readers may have to purchase access to journals—or specific articles—themselves at significant personal cost. With a subscription model, researchers and institutions have to carefully consider how they allocate funds. Many articles remain locked behind paywalls, limiting access to only the largest institutions and denying access to the general public. This causes frustration and, more importantly, hampers scientific progress. This model causes gaps to appear between institutions with different levels of funding and disadvantages researchers from developing regions.Public money and charitable organizations fund most current academic research. In effect, this model makes readers purchase access to materials that they helped fund through government spending and charitable donations.Open Access ensures that articles are free at the point of consumption. Rather than charge for access, Open Access publishers apply an initial fee at the time an article is accepted for publication. This fee, known as an Article Processing Charge (APC), covers the costs of the production process. Often this charge will be covered by the authors’ affiliated institution(s), or by the funding body responsible for commissioning the research. See ‘What are Article Processing Charges?’ for more details.By using a liberal copyright license, Open Access removes barriers and allows researchers to make use of articles in new ways. This includes practices like meta-analysis and text mining, which help reveal trends in science that would not be obvious at the level of individual articles.The following infographic explains the benefits of Open Access publishing—Open Access Explained: An Infographic.   \n",

      "\t\t\t\tWhat are Article Processing Charges?Like other Open Access publishers, Hindawi charges an Article Processing Charge once an article is accepted for publication. These charges cover the costs of turning a manuscript into a finished article. Hindawi is committed to making the costs of publishing as clear as possible. The charges for each journal are clearly displayed on the journal’s home page.You can find a full list of Hindawi’s charges on our APCs page.When a manuscript is submitted, it passes through the many different departments at Hindawi:The Editorial Screening team, who perform initial technical and ethical checks.The Editorial team, who help the journal's Academic Editors manage the review process.The Production team, who convert the manuscript to a professionally typeset article and well-structured XML.The Proofing team, who coordinate the proofing process through Hindawi's Online Proofing System (OPS).The Editorial Quality Assurance team, who perform a final check to ensure that the manuscript and its review process adhere to the journal's guidelines and policies.Our marketing and communications teams, who ensure your article receives the attention it deserves. The technology team, who build and maintain our systems.The actual amount payable as an APC varies depending on the journal in which you wish to publish your article. Some journals are more expensive, due to the volume of submissions they receive.Hindawi offers a waiver program for researchers working in certain countries. Your APC will be waived if you meet the eligibility requirements. See our waiver policy for more details.In some situations an APC may be discounted or paid on your behalf. If your institution is a member of the Hindawi Institutional Partnership program, your APC may be discounted by up to 100%. Speak to your institutional librarian if you are interested in this opportunity.\n",

Research leads to breakthroughs, and communicating the results of research is what allows us to turn breakthroughs into better lives—to provide new treatments for disease, to implement solutions for challenges like global warming, and to build entire industries around what were once just ideas.\n",
      "However, our current system for communicating research is crippled by a centuries old model that hasn’t been updated to take advantage of 21st century technology:\n",
      "\n",
      "Governments provide most of the funding for research—hundreds of billions of dollars annually—and public institutions employ a large portion of all researchers.\n",
      "Researchers publish their findings without the expectation of compensation. Unlike other authors, they hand their work over to publishers without payment, in the interest of advancing human knowledge.\n",
      "Through the process of peer review, researchers review each other’s work for free.\n",
      "Once published, those that contributed to the research (from taxpayers to the institutions that supported the research itself) have to pay again to access the findings. Though research is produced as a public good, it isn’t available to the public who paid for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our current system for communicating research uses a print-based model in the digital age. Even though research is largely produced with public dollars by researchers who share it freely, the results are hidden behind technical, legal, and financial barriers. These artificial barriers are maintained by legacy publishers and restrict access to a small fraction of users, locking out most of the world’s population and preventing the use of new research techniques.\n",
      "This fundamental mismatch between what is possible with digital technology—an open system for communicating research results in which anyone, anywhere can contribute—and our outdated publishing system has led to the call for Open Access.\n",
      "Open Access is the free, immediate, online availability of research articles combined with the rights to use these articles fully in the digital environment. Open Access is the needed modern update for the communication of research that fully utilizes the Internet for what it was originally built to do—accelerate research.\n",
      "Funders invest in research to advance human knowledge and ultimately improve lives. Open Access increases the return on that investment by ensuring the results of the research they fund can be read and built on by anyone.\n",
      "Breakthroughs often come from unexpected places; the Theory of Relativity was developed by a patent clerk. Open Access expands the number of potential contributors to research from just those at institutions wealthy enough to afford journal subscriptions to anyone with an internet connection.\n",
      "Researchers benefit from having the widest possible audience. Researchers provide their articles to publishers for free, because their compensation comes in the form of recognition for their findings. Open Access means more readers, more potential collaborators, more citations for their work, and ultimately more recognition.\n",
      "The research enterprise itself benefits when the latest techniques can be easily used. For years, we have had powerful text and data mining tools that can analyze the entire research literature, uncovering trends and connections that no human reader could. While publishers’ technical and legal barriers currently prevent their widespread use, Open Access empowers anyone to use these tools, which hold the potential of revolutionizing how research is conducted.\n",
      "Even the best ideas remain just that until they are shared, until they can be utilized by others. The more people that can access and build upon the latest research, the more valuable that research becomes and the more likely we are to benefit as a society. More eyes make for smaller problems.\n",

      "Open Access Policies   In 2008, Harvard's Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences voted unanimously to give the Harvard a nonexclusive, irrevocable right to distribute their scholarly articles for any non-commercial purpose. In the years since, the remaining eight Harvard schools voted similar open-access (OA) policies; as of September 2017, four research centers have joined their number. In the words of OSC Director Peter Suber, author of Open Access, \"The basic idea of OA is simple: Make research literature available online without price barriers and without most permission barriers.\" Scholarly articles provided to the university are stored, preserved, and made freely accessible in digital form in DASH, Harvard University Library's open access repository. The repository has the institution of Harvard standing behind it to ensure its availability, longevity, and functionality. Harvard Authors If you are a Harvard author and have questions about when and how the policy applies to your work, please review our Authors page, or contact us. Beyond Harvard If you are considering adopting an open access policy at your institution, we encourage you to download and review our model policy language, which represents the accumulated experience of multiple institutions that have drafted and implemented open access policies.

Contact the OSC or the Open Access Liaison for your community.     WHY OPEN ACCESS? Q: Why are we doing this? Harvard University has long had a policy that \"when entering into agreements for the publication and distribution of copyrighted materials, authors will make arrangements that best serve the public interest.\" In the eyes of many, including the Provost's Committee on Scholarly Publishing and large numbers of individual faculty members, this goal is best served by using the unified action of the faculty to enable individual faculty to distribute their scholarly writings freely. Other organizations with a vested interest in advancing research are independently supporting such efforts as well. For instance, the Wellcome Trust requires any scholarly articles on research they fund to be made openly accessible. The National Institutes of Health, by Congressional legislation, have instituted a similar requirement, mandating posting in the open-access PubMed Central repository.  Return to Why open access? Return to top   Q: What do the Harvard open-access policies provide? The policies have two basic provisions. First, faculty commit to deposit a certain version of their future scholarly articles in DASH, Harvard's open-access repository. Second, faculty grant certain nonexclusive rights over their future scholarly articles to Harvard, authorizing it to make those deposited articles open access. This grant of nonexclusive rights is not equivalent to a grant of ownership. It includes waiver and embargo options to enhance author freedom and control over their work. Sometimes we call this grant of nonexclusive rights the Harvard open-access license. The policies do not require authors to submit new scholarly articles to any particular type of journals, such as open-access journals. On the contrary, the policies deliberately allow authors to submit new work to the journals of their choice. All Harvard schools now have open-access policies, each one adopted by faculty vote. In their major provisions, they are identical.  Return to Why open access? Return to top   Q: Why do the open-access policies include an automatic or default license? Why not just suggest authors individually retain a license for open-access distribution? First, experience has shown that mere encouragement has little effect. For instance, before Congress made it a requirement, participation in the NIH Public Access Policy was optional. During that period, there was only a 4% level of compliance. During the same period studies showed that the low level of compliance was not due to opposition so much as preoccupation, busyness, and forgetfulness. Second, experience in many areas has shown that opt-out systems achieve much higher degrees of participation than opt-in systems, even while remaining noncoercive. Third, by making faculty-wide policies, individual faculty benefit from their membership in the policy-making group. The university can work with publishers on behalf of the faculty to simplify procedures and broaden access. Without a policy covering many authors, we could not take full advantage of the benefit of unified action. The school-level policies at Harvard only cover faculty. However, non-faculty scholars may create a similar license for their own work through the voluntary individual open-access license.  Return to Why open access? Return to top   Q: What are the advantages for authors? The Harvard open-access license:  Gives authors permission to make their work open access without the difficulty or uncertainty of negotiating with publishers; Enables the university to help authors make their works open access; Preserves author freedom to publish in the journals of their choice; Preserves author freedom to decide for or against open access for each publication; and Enhances author rights to reuse their work, and gives authors more rights over their own work than standard, or even progressive, publishing contracts.  The chief benefit of the open-access license is the way it fosters open access itself. While the benefits of open access itself are too numerous to list here, we will mention one. Research has repeatedly shown that articles that are free online are cited more often than articles that are not free online, and this trend is increasing over time. This phenomenon is often called the open-access citation or impact advantage.  Return to Why open access? Return to top   Q: What will Harvard do with the articles covered by its license? Here are some examples:   Availability in DASH. Harvard has set up an open-access repository called DASH to distribute the scholarly articles deposited by Harvard researchers.   Reuse by the author. When Harvard receives the grant of nonexclusive rights from faculty, it grants the same rights back to the faculty. The result is that faculty receive more rights from the OA policy, to use and reuse their own work, than they received under their publishing contracts.   Creation of derivative works. Harvard may use derivative work rights to include articles in a collection or database, to change document formats, to prepare abridgments, or to create other derivative works that we cannot currently foresee. Harvard will not authorize derivative works without the author's permission.   Non-commercial distribution. Through the transferability provision, Harvard may further allow others to distribute content in DASH, provided that the articles are not sold for profit. For instance, faculty at other institutions could be given permission to make copies for free distribution directly to their students.   Instructional purposes. The Harvard open-access license grants Harvard the right to license articles for free use in a course pack, so long as the course pack is not sold for profit. Alternatively, those seeking to include articles in a coursepack could continue to get permissions from the publisher, typically by paying royalties to the publisher. To take another example, Harvard could also authorize others to make articles available online (for example, on a course website or another repository), provided that these were not sold for a profit.   Harvesting, indexing, and other services. Consistent with the goals of open access and ensuring wide visibility and availability of scholarly articles, the license allows Harvard to enable both commercial and nonprofit entities to use the articles to provide search or other services, so long as the articles are not being sold for a profit. For instance, the license allows Harvard to enable the articles to be harvested and indexed by search services, such as Google Scholar, and to be used to provide other value-added services that don't involve selling the articles themselves for a profit. Harvard also could authorize use of the articles in a commercial service that provides information extracted from the articles (but not the full text itself), such as bibliographic data or citation lists.   Technological innovation. If new means of distributing or making the articles available evolve during the lengthy term of copyright, the license is intended to give Harvard the flexibility to use those means to advance the purposes of the open-access policy, provided always that the articles are not sold for a profit.    Return to Why open access? Return to top   POLICY AND LICENSE BASICS Q: What kinds of writings do the open-access policies cover? Only scholarly articles. We focus on scholarly articles because, in the language of the Budapest Open Access Initiative, these are the primary works that scholars publish \"for the sake of inquiry and knowledge\" and \"give to the world without expectation of payment.\" Scholarly articles are typically presented in peer-reviewed scholarly journals and conference proceedings. While DASH, the Harvard repository, welcomes scholarly works other than articles, the policies only cover articles. Among the works outside the category of scholarly articles are books, popular articles, commissioned articles, fiction and poetry, encyclopedia entries, ephemeral writings, lecture notes, and lecture videos. If you wonder whether a given work is covered the policies or welcome in DASH, please contact the Office for Scholarly Communication. Like the school-level policies for faculty, the voluntary individual open-access license is also limited to scholarly articles.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: What version of a scholarly article should authors deposit in the repository? The policies ask authors to deposit \"the final version of the article\". But since our policies were adopted, the more self-explanatory term \"accepted author manuscript\" has become more widely accepted for describing the version we have in mind. The accepted author manuscript of a work is the version approved by peer review, or the last version the author sends to the publisher after peer review. It does not include unilateral edits made by the journal after peer review, or the journal's look and feel. In a few cases we will deposit the published version, also called the version of record. For example, we will deposit this version when Harvard's HOPE fund pays an article processing charge for that article, or when the publisher gives permission to deposit that version. If you're not certain whether we could deposit the version of record in a given case, please contact the Office for Scholarly Communication.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: Does the license to Harvard apply to articles I wrote before the policy was adopted? No. The school-level open-access policies do not apply to any articles that were completed before the policy at your school was adopted, nor to any articles for which you entered into an incompatible publishing agreement before the policy was adopted. If you are non-faculty author, you are not subject to the school-level policies. However, if you sign the voluntary individual open-access license, then it too will not apply to articles written before you signed the license.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: Does the policy apply to articles I write after leaving Harvard? No. Once you are no longer affiliated with Harvard, any articles you write will not be subject to the open-access policies at your school and will not be licensed to Harvard. Likewise, the voluntary individual open-access license applies only as long as the author is affiliated with Harvard.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: How do I request a waiver of the Harvard license? You may request a waiver of the license granted to Harvard on an article-by-article basis. Simply use the Waiver Generator. Even if you obtain a waiver for a given article, you should still deposit the accepted author manuscript in DASH. It can be made available after a delay, or kept \"dark\" depending on the nature of your publication agreement. The OSC can help determine what kind of distribution is appropriate for the work. If your article is subject to the NIH Public Access policy, note that your obligations under the NIH Public Access Policy cannot be waived. The same may be true of open-access policies at some other funding agencies. Look up your funder in the ROARMAP database for more information.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: Does the license to Harvard apply to co-authored papers? Yes. If you are a co-author of an article, you should inform your fellow co-authors about the nonexclusive license that you have granted Harvard under the school-level open-access policies (or the individual open-access license. If they object to the license, and cannot be convinced it is beneficial, then remember that you can obtain a waiver for the article. Each joint author of an article holds copyright in the article and, individually, has the authority to grant Harvard a nonexclusive license. However, one waiver from one author is sufficient to waive the license to Harvard. Please contact us with any questions you may have about seeking a waiver for a co-authored paper.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: What if my article is subject to the NIH Public Access Policy? Your article will be subject to the NIH Public Access Policy if it is peer reviewed and arose, in whole or in part, from NIH-funded research and is accepted for publication on or after April 7, 2008. The NIH policy cannot be waived. (The same is true of open-access policies from many other funding agencies. Look up your funder in the ROARMAP database for more information.) You may, however, obtain a waiver of the license to Harvard for an article. The license granted to Harvard through the school-level policies and the individual open-access license includes rights sufficient to comply with the NIH policy, but also provides other nonexclusive rights that will enable Harvard and faculty authors to use their articles in additional ways—for example, depositing them in a Harvard repository. For more on compliance with the NIH policy, please see the details and instructions from Harvard Medical School.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: Are students covered by the Harvard open-access policies? Not in general. But if they are graduate students, their theses and dissertations will usually become open access. And, any student may volunteer to be covered by signing Harvard’s individual open-access license.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: What if I'm a non-faculty author and would like my scholarly articles to be covered by an open-access license? Harvard faculty are already covered by open-access licenses through the school-level open-access policies. Current administrators, librarians, staff, postdocs, fellows, students, and other non-faculty researchers at Harvard may create a similar license for themselves through the voluntary individual open-access license. But with or without an open-access license, scholarly works by Harvard affiliates are welcome in DASH.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: I'm a graduate student. How do I make my thesis or dissertation open access? You will be submitting your thesis or dissertation through ETDs @ Harvard, Harvard's centrally supported and locally customized electronic submission system. Submission consists of a simple five-step process that takes about 10 minutes to complete. During this time you will provide contact information for, document metadata about, and upload a PDF of your work. You will have the opportunity to submit an ORCID in the submission process. Additionally, you will be agreeing to Harvard’s author agreement, which grants the University a non-exclusive license to preserve, reproduce, and display your work. Once approved by your School, your thesis or dissertation will be sent to various downstream Library systems, including DASH (for access); DRS (for preservation); and HOLLIS (for discovery). If you have questions related to this process or about any associated policies, then please contact your degree-granting department. If you have questions about DASH, then please contact the Office for Scholarly Communication.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   Q: What is the individual open-access license? This a voluntary open-access license that any Harvard researchers may choose for their own scholarly articles. Because Harvard faculty are already covered by open-access licenses through the school-level open-access policies, in practice the individual open-access license is for non-faculty researchers, such as administrators, librarians, staff, postdocs, fellows, and students. Through the school-level open-access policies, faculty grant Harvard certain nonexclusive rights to their future scholarly articles. These enable Harvard to make a certain version of those articles open access through DASH, Harvard's open-access repository. Moreover, they enable Harvard to grant the same rights back to the authors. The individual open-access license grants Harvard exactly the same set of nonexclusive rights, for exactly the same purposes. In that sense, it gives non-faculty researchers the same benefits that the school-level policies give faculty. Just as faculty may obtain waivers from their open-access license, those who sign the individual open-access license may also obtain waivers. To sign the Individual Open-Access License, just sign our assistance authorization form. The license works best when authors sign it before they sign publishing contracts. For that reason, and because it permits waivers for any given work, we encourage interested authors to sign the open-access license soon, or before they publish their next scholarly article. Authors only need to sign the license once for the rest of their career at Harvard, not once per paper. It lasts as long as the author is affiliated with Harvard.  Return to Policy and license basics Return to top   COMMON CONCERNS Q: Can my articles be used as the basis of derivative works by other authors? Yes. Harvard may permit you and others to make derivative works based on the articles that fall under the open-access license, whether you are covered by a school-level policy or the voluntary individual open-access license. However, Harvard would only exercise this right with permission from the author and in order to advance the aims of the policy. Harvard recognizes authors' interest in the integrity of their scholarly articles. If Harvard allows the display or distribution of any derivative work that modifies the substance of the original document (e.g., an abridgment), it will require that the derivative work include a citation, hyperlink or similar reference to the original document and that it appropriately identify the nature of the revision (e.g., \"abridged from…\"). As technology and modes of distributing and using scholarly content evolve, it may serve the interests of research and education for Harvard to adjust the derivative-work rights granted to the public. In any such decisions, the Office for Scholarly Communication will be guided by its Faculty Advisory Committee.  Return to Common concerns Return to top   Q: Is the university acquiring ownership of my writing? No. Authors still retain ownership and control of the copyright in their writings, subject only to Harvard's prior, nonexclusive license. For non-faculty authors, the individual open-access license only covers authors who choose to sign it. Even then it is like the faculty licenses, and leaves ownership and control in the hands of the authors, subject only to the nonexclusive rights previously granted to Harvard.  Return to Common concerns Return to top   Q: Will Harvard ever sell articles for profit or allow others to do so? No. Harvard does not have the right to sell for a profit the articles under the license, and cannot grant this right to others. The same applies to a coursepack or book containing such articles.  Return to Common concerns Return to top   Q: What if a journal publisher refuses to publish my article because of this prior license to Harvard? You have a number of options, whether you are covered by the school-level open-access policies or the individual open-access license. You may:  Obtain a waiver of the license and let the publisher know that you have done so; or Obtain an embargo to delay deposit of the work in DASH and let the publisher know you have done so; or Work to persuade the publisher that it should accept Harvard's nonexclusive license in order to be able to publish your article; or finally, Try to seek a different publisher. The Office for Scholarly Communication would be happy to help in the process of working with publishers or picking an option that works best for you.  We have not heard of a single case in which a journal has refused to publish an article merely because of the prior license to Harvard. This is because the waiver and embargo options offer complete protection to publishers who wish to take advantage of them.  Return to Common concerns Return to top   Q: Does this website provide legal advice to me? No. This website provides information and resources to help faculty members and others understand the open-access policy and to assist in compliance, but does not provide individual legal advice. The Office for Scholarly Communication and its staff also are not able to provide individual legal advice. If you wish legal advice about your copyrights or individual situation, you should consult your own attorney.  Return to Common concerns Return to top   DEPOSITING ARTICLES IN DASH Q: Should I include my article in DASH even if I have gotten a waiver for it? Yes. If your article cannot be made publicly available because you obtained a waiver of the Harvard license, we encourage you to deposit a copy in DASH, Harvard's open-access repository. We will make it \"dark\". We will not make the text open access, but will store it for preservation purposes. We will provide open access to the metadata or bibliographic information, to facilitate indexing by search engines and public awareness of your article. Even if you obtain a waiver, the publisher's agreement may provide sufficient rights to allow copies of your article to be made publicly available through the Harvard repository. You may also be able to negotiate these rights. The publisher may ask that certain conditions be met, some of which the repository can accommodate (for example, an embargo period during which the article will not be made publicly available). Information about publishers' standard policies on open access is available from the SHERPA/RoMEO project (though Harvard has not verified the accuracy of that information).  Return to Depositing articles in dash Return to top   Q: Should I include my article in DASH even if the work is not covered by the Harvard license? Much of your work — for example, anything authored before the date an open-access policy was passed in your school or before you signed the individual open-access license — is not covered by the license to Harvard. In those cases, your right to reuse your own work is limited to the terms of the agreements you signed with your publishers. In most cases, those publishing agreements give you more extensive reuse rights for the accepted author manuscript than for the published version or version of record. Hence, even when you are not allowed to distribute the published version, you may be able to make your accepted author manuscript available for download in DASH without violating the agreement with your publisher. Let us investigate this for you and we'll make a recommendation.  Return to Depositing articles in dash Return to top   Q: What is a dark deposit? A dark deposit is a work in DASH whose full text is not open access, even when information about the work (citation, abstract, etc.) is open access. We try to minimize dark deposits, and make all DASH deposits open access. But we make deposits dark in two circumstances:  When the author has requested an embargo, and When we don't have rights to provide open access to the version(s) available to us.  In the first case, we make the work dark during the embargo period, and open access when the embargo expires. In the second case, we might lack the relevant rights for a number of reasons:  The author has obtained a waiver of the license granted to Harvard; The work was published before the author granted nonexclusive rights to Harvard, either through the open-access policy at his/her school or with the individual open-access license; or Our rights only apply to a certain version of the work and we don't yet have a copy of that version.  Regardless of the cause, we will make a version of the work open access if or when we obtain the rights to do so. In general, when a work is subject to a Harvard open-access policy, we have nonexclusive rights to provide open access to the accepted author manuscript (AAM), and not the version of record (VOR). If the author submits the VOR to DASH, either we hold it or make it dark until we can obtain the AAM or until we obtain permission to distribute the VOR.  Return to Depositing articles in dash Return to top   Q: I've already published a large number of articles. What's the easiest way to get all of them into DASH? The Office for Scholarly Communication (OSC) offers a service called CV Scraping in which we deposit your past articles retroactively into DASH. Learn more about this free service, including how to request a CV Scrape.  Return to Depositing articles in dash Return to top   USING AN AUTHOR ADDENDUM Q: What is an author addendum? An author addendum is a proposed modification of a publishing contract. If accepted by the publisher, it modifies the contract, for example, in order to take proper account of the Harvard open-access license or to allow author to retain rights that would otherwise have been transferred to the publisher. Here is a sample addendum developed specifically to deal with the prior license granted to Harvard.  Return to Using an author addendum Return to top   Q: How do I use an author addendum? Complete an appropriate form of addendum, sign and date the form, add a statement to the publisher's agreement making it subject to the addendum, and attach the addendum to the publisher's agreement. We recommend the addendum generator to authors subject to school-level policies or the individual open-access license. If you have questions about how to use the addendum generator, contact the Office for Scholarly Communication.  Return to Using an author addendum Return to top   Q: What if my article has co-authors? Even if you are not the corresponding author, you may still decide to use the addendum with the publisher's agreement so that the terms of the agreement will not be in conflict with the license granted to Harvard. You can use the addendum generator to create an addendum for the article that may be used by your corresponding co-author.  Return to Using an author addendum Return to top   Q: What if the journal publisher refuses to accept my addendum or wants to negotiate it? You have a number of options. Whether you are covered by the school-level policies or the individual open-access license, you may obtain a waiver of the license granted to Harvard. Alternatively, you can work to persuade the publisher that it should accept Harvard's non-exclusive license in order to be able to publish your article, or you may seek a different publisher. You can consult with the Office for Scholarly Communication for help in the process of working with publishers and addressing their specific concerns.  Return to Using an author addendum Return to top   Q: What if a publisher tells me I don't need the addendum because the publisher's agreement already permits immediate posting of the article in an institutional open-access repository? It may still be a good idea to use the addendum. The nonexclusive license to Harvard enables the university to allow you and others to make various beneficial uses of the article, which may be in conflict with provisions of the publication agreement. To avoid a conflicting transfer of copyright to the publisher and to protect yourself from breach of contract, you may still want to attach an addendum. If the publisher's agreement, however, is wholly consistent with Harvard's license, you would not need to use the addendum.

      "\n",
      " If you're worried about paying fees out of pocket, here's some background to help you estimate the odds. Although charging publication fees is the best-known business model for peer-reviewed OA journals, it's not the most common. Only about 30% of peer-reviewed OA journals overall charge publication fees (update). When OA journals do charge fees, the fees are usually paid by funders (59%) or by universities (24%). Only 12% of the time are they paid by authors out of pocket. See Table 4 of the comprehensive Study of Open Access Publishing (SOAP). That means that only 3.6% of authors who publish in OA journals overall (12% of 31%) pay fees out of pocket. At the same time, about 50% of articles published in peer-reviewed OA journals are published in fee-based journals. Hence, if we count by article rather than by journal, then only 6% of authors who publish in OA journals overall (12% of 50%) pay fees out of pocket. These figures are averages, and the rates depend significantly on field and type of employer; see Figure 8 of the SOAP study. (SOAP was published in 2011, and I haven't seen more recent data. If you have, please let me know.)\n",
      "\n",
      " If you want to see how a given journal's fee compares with others, and how it correlates with the journal's impact or influence, see FlourishOA.\n",
      "\n",
      " If you want to know whether a given journal charges a publication fee, then the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) will tell you. If the journal is not listed in the DOAJ, then reconsider whether it's the right journal for you. For more, see the next entry on assessing the quality of an unknown journal.\n",

      " Also follow the progress of Cabell's, JournalGuide, JournalReviewer, Open Access Journal Finder,  Peer Review Evaluation (PRE), Quality Open Access Market (QOAM), SciRev, and Think-Check-Submit. All these services are trying different ways to solve the same problem.\n",
      "\n",
      " Don't assume that unknown journals are weak. Low profile does not imply low quality, especially when journals are new, and the average OA journal is significantly newer than the average conventional journal. New journals, OA and non-OA, face the vicious circle of needing excellent submissions to generate reputation, and needing reputation to attract excellent submissions. Don't fault a journal for being only partway through the process of escaping this circle. Look to its quality alone, as far as you can determine it. Even journals excellent from birth need time to develop a reputation in proportion to their quality. When an honest, new, and little-known journal is struggling for visibility, you can help it escape the circle by submitting some of your best work. In the words of Harvard's Faculty Advisory Council on the Library (April 2012), \"move prestige to open access.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " Is the publisher a member of the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA)? OASPA has a good code of conduct and set of membership criteria requiring peer review, requiring disclosure of a journal's vetting process, fees, and ownership, and prohibiting spam to solicit papers or members of editorial boards. Also see the DOAJ Principles of Transparency. Some honest, high-quality OA publishers do not yet belong to OASPA, and some honest, high-quality OA journals are not yet listed in the DOAJ. But we should encourage them to apply. If your investigation of a particular journal doesn't turn up evidence that you trust one way or another, then follow the rule to avoid publishers who aren't members of OASPA and journals that aren't listed in the DOAJ. Don't hesitate to tell them that you are doing so. That will give them an incentive to join, and live up to their professional standards. \n",
      "\n",
      " Similarly, if institutions must decide which OA journals to support, they could require OASPA membership and/or DOAJ listing, and say so on a public web page. (This is the approach we take with the Harvard HOPE Fund.) That will strengthen the incentive for OA publishers and journals to live up to the standards set by OASPA and DOAJ. \n",

      " Unfortunately the two facts above are among the best-kept secrets of OA, and must compete against some of the most widespread misunderstandings about OA, for example, that all OA is gold OA, that publishing in a non-OA journal forecloses the possibility of OA, that the relevant rights always belong to publishers, and that non-OA publishers are doing nothing to adapt to an OA world or accommodate authors who want OA.\n",
      "\n",
      " Important conclusion, especially for early-career researchers: Some OA journals are among the top journals in their fields, whether we measure this status by citations, altmetrics, downloads, or reputation. This set of OA journals grows with time. But some hiring, promotion, and tenure committees don't yet recognize any OA journals among the top journals in their field. If that's your situation (given your field and your committee), and if you need the imprimatur of a \"top journal\" for your career, then don't conclude that there's a tradeoff between OA and your career. At worst there's only a tradeoff between gold OA and your career. Don't forget the green OA option, and don't fail to take advantage of it. Publish in the best journal that will accept your work. (Get your career so that you can fight for OA from inside.) If that journal isn't OA, then deposit the same article at the same time in an OA repository.\n",

      "\n",
      "A complete education: students in any discipline need access to the latest research to have a complete education in their field of study and hit the ground running after graduation. Limited access to research makes students settle for the information that is available rather than that which is most relevant. &#160;Open Access can ensure students get the best possible education and are not artificially limited by the selection of scholarly journals their campuses are able to provide.\n",

Just as one example, in a recent lecture I was preparing for our medical students... I was only able to access about two thirds of the articles that I needed in order to make sure that I was providing these budding young doctors with everything they needed to know about the subject. I can tell you that’s extremely frustrating to me as an educator and it’s clearly not in the best interests of my students.&#160;This problem isn’t unique to the University of Vermont. Every academic institution faces this problem – from the best-funded private institutions down to the small liberal arts colleges and community colleges. It’s just a question of degree.\n",

      "Research for papers: it’s a familiar story; you’re writing a paper for class and you need to cite articles from peer-reviewed journals. Eventually, you find an article that looks good — maybe via a search engine, a footnote from another source, or a reference in an index. You search the Web for the full text, but you can’t get past the abstract. You look on your library’s Web site but they don’t have a subscription. You’re stuck. Maybe that article would have been a major source for your work — you’ll never know. You don’t have access. &#160;Open Access changes that. No more worrying about whether you’re on the campus network or if your library has a subscription. If you’re online, you have &#160;access, period — anywhere in the world.\n",

If they take a job at another university, that institution may have a very different level of access than what they need, and if they take a job outside of the university setting, they will no longer have the library to provide them any access to journals.\n",

OA eliminates DRM (authenticating users, distinguishing authorized from unauthorized users, blocking access to the unauthorized). OA reduces or eliminates legal expenses (drafting and enforcing restrictive licenses). Many OA journals eliminate marketing and rely solely on spontaneous aid from other players, such as search engines, bloggers, discussion forums, social tagging, and social networking.

For these reasons there is a growing trend among scholarly authors to retain the right to provide green OA and only transfer the remaining bundle of rights to publishers. Some do this through author addenda which modify the publisher's standard copyright transfer agreement. Some funders (like the Wellcome Trust and NIH) require authors to retain key rights when publishing journal articles. At some universities (like Harvard and MIT) faculty have granted the university the non-exclusive right to provide OA to their work. \n",

There may be good reasons to create opt-outs for authors, as Harvard does, but there's no need to create opt-outs for publishers. When authors authorize OA while they are still the copyright holders, they needn't seek permission from publishers later on and needn't worry about infringement. Funders and universities are upstream from publishers and can adopt policies to ensure green OA and the permissions to make it lawful. \n",

Because authors cannot close this gap on their own, funders and universities who fail to close the gap have no one else to blame if fast-rising journal prices enlarge the fast-growing fraction of new research inaccessible to those who need it.

The consequences may or may not overlap (this is contingent) but the purposes do not overlap. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even though journal prices have risen four times faster than inflation since the mid-1980's, the purpose of OA is not to punish or undermine expensive journals, but to provide an accessible alternative and take full advantage of new technology &#151;the internet&#151; for widening distribution and reducing costs. Moreover, for researchers themselves, the overriding motivation is not to solve the journal pricing crisis but to deliver wider and easier access for readers and larger audience and impact for authors. \n",

      "Publishers are not monolithic. Some already provide full OA, some provide hybrid models, some are experimenting, and some are considering experiments. Among those not providing OA, some are opposed and some are merely unpersuaded. Among the unpersuaded, some provide more free online content than others. Among the opposed, some have merely decided not to provide it themselves, while others lobby actively against policies to encourage or require it. Some oppose gold but not green OA, while others oppose green but not gold OA. OA gains nothing and loses potential allies by blurring these distinctions. \n",

      "Readers:&nbsp; OA gives them barrier-free access to the literature they need for their research, unconstrained by the budgets of the libraries where they may have access privileges. OA increases reader reach and retrieval power. OA also gives barrier-free access to the software they use in their research. Free online literature is free online data for software that facilitates full-text searching, indexing, mining, summarizing, translating, querying, linking, recommending, alerting, \"mash-ups\" and other forms of processing and analysis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Teachers and students:&nbsp; OA puts rich and poor on an equal footing for these key resources and eliminates the need for payments or permissions to reproduce and distribute content. \n",
      "\n",
      "Libraries:&nbsp; OA solves the pricing crisis for scholarly journals. It also solves what I've called the permission crisis. OA also serves library interests in other, indirect ways. Librarians want to help users find the information they need, regardless of the budget-enforced limits on the library's own collection. Academic librarians want to help faculty increase their audience and impact, and help the university raise its research profile. \n",
      "\n",
      "Universities:&nbsp; OA increases the visibility of their faculty and research, reduces their expenses for journals, and advances their mission to share knowledge. \n",
      "\n",
      "Journals and publishers:&nbsp; OA makes their articles more visible, discoverable, retrievable, and useful. If a journal is OA, then it can use this superior visibility to attract submissions and advertising, not to mention readers and citations. If a subscription-based journal provides OA to some of its content (e.g. selected articles in each issue, all back issues after a certain period, etc.), then it can use its increased visibility to attract all the same benefits plus subscriptions. If a journal permits OA through postprint archiving, then it has an edge in attracting authors over journals that do not permit postprint archiving. Of course subscription-based journals and their publishers have countervailing interests as well and often resist or oppose OA. But it oversimplifies the situation to think that all their interests pull against OA. \n",
      "\n",
      "Funding agencies:&nbsp; OA increases the return on their investment in research, making the results of the funded research more widely available, more discoverable, more retrievable, and more useful. When funding agencies disburse public funds, OA helps in a second way as well, by providing fundamental fairness to taxpayers or public access to the results of publicly-funded research. \n",

      "Citizens:&nbsp; OA gives them access to peer-reviewed research, most of which is unavailable in public libraries, and gives them access to the research for which they have already paid through their taxes. But even those with no interest in reading this literature for themselves will benefit indirectly because researchers will benefit directly. OA accelerates not only research but the translation of research into new medicines, useful technologies, solved problems, and informed decisions that benefit everyone. \n",

      "\n",
      "Journals took off because they were more timely than books. For readers, journals were better than books for learning quickly about the recent work of others. For authors they were better than books for sharing new work quickly with the wider world and for establishing priority over other scientists working on the same problem. Journals gave authors the benefit of a fast, public time-stamp on their work. Because authors were rewarded in these strong, intangible ways, they accepted the fact that journals couldn't afford to pay them. Over time, journal revenue grew but authors continued in the tradition of writing articles for impact, not for money. \n",
      "\n",
      "OA was physically and economically impossible in the age of print, even if the copyright holder wanted it. Prices were not only unavoidable for print journals, they were even affordable until the 1970's, when they began to rise faster than inflation. Journal subscription prices have risen nearly four times faster than inflation since 1986. Fortuitously, just as journal prices were becoming unbearable, the internet emerged to offer an alternative. \n",

      "It doesn't matter whether we blame unaffordable journals on excessive publisher prices or inadequate library budgets. If we focus on publishers, it doesn't matter whether we blame greed or innocent market forces (rising costs and new services). Blame is irrelevant and distracting. The volume of published knowledge is growing exponentially and will always grow faster than library budgets. In that sense, OA scales with the growth of knowledge and toll access does not. We've already (long since) reached the point at which even affluent research institutions cannot afford access to the full range of research literature. Priced access to journal articles would not scale with the continuing, explosive growth of knowledge even if prices were low today and guaranteed to remain low forever. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pricing crisis itself is just one factor in the rise of OA. Even if scholars did not turn to OA in order to bypass unaffordable access fees, they'd turn to it in order to take advantage of the internet as a powerful new technology for sharing knowledge instantly, with a worldwide audience, at zero marginal cost, in a digital form amenable to unlimited processing. \n",

Moreover, the author may post to the archive a list of corrigenda, or differences between the preprint and postprint.

As long as they are labelled as preprints, there is no misleading of readers and no dilution of the body of refereed or peer-reviewed literature.

The standards by which they have been judged and recommended are those of journals in the field, and these standards do not depend on a journal's medium (print or electronic) or cost (priced or free).

The main reason is that the people involved in the editorial process, and the standards they use, do not depend on the medium (print or electronic) or the cost (priced or free) of the publication. This is clearest in the case when the very same people who edit print or limited-access journals also edit open-access journals, either because their journal appears in two versions or because they resigned from a journal that didn't support open access and created a new open-access journal to serve the same scholarly community.

As it is currently spent, the money buys access only for the buyer, so that access is limited to those who can afford the price. If instead the money covers the costs of disseminating articles online, then the articles could be freely accessible to everyone. In short, the solution is to use existing funds to pay per outgoing article (dissemination), not per incoming article (access).

Part of the answer is to reduce costs e.g. by publishing online-only rather than in print, using software to automate common tasks, and providing essentials without inessentials. The most important essential for an open access publisher is peer review. (Open access publishers needn't spend any money managing subscriptions or blocking access to non-subscribers.) The rest of the answer is funding. For some journals, the cost of providing open access can be supplied by the author's university or the grant funding the author's research (waiving this fee for authors who have no source to pay these costs). This can be construed as buying electronic reprints (as conceived by Thomas Walker) or as covering the cost of dissemination as part of the cost of research (as practiced by BioMed Central). Over time many journals will find that they can replace subscription or license fees with article charges and thereby provide open access to a growing portion of their content.

The re-use rights of libre OA are often specified by various specific Creative Commons licenses;&#91;14&#93; these almost all require attribution of authorship to the original authors.&#91;13&#93;&#91;15&#93;\n",

      "There are many financial models for open access publications.&#91;17&#93; Open access can be provided by commercial publishers, who may publish open access as well as subscription-based journals, or dedicated open-access publishers such as Public Library of Science (PLOS) and BioMed Central.\n",

      "In one model of open access, journals generate revenue by charging publication fees in order to make the work openly available at the time of publication.&#91;18&#93;&#91;7&#93;&#91;8&#93; The money might come from the author but more often comes from the author's research grant or employer.&#91;citation needed&#93; Some publishers will waive all or part of the fee for authors from less developed economies. Journals charging publication fees normally take various steps to ensure that peer reviewers do not know whether authors have requested, or been granted, fee waivers, or to ensure that every paper is approved by an independent editor with no financial stake in the journal.&#91;citation needed&#93; While the payments are often incurred per article published (e.g. BMC journals or PLOS ONE), there are some journals that apply them per manuscript submitted (e.g. Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics until recently) or per author (PeerJ). As of June 2018, only 26% of journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) required payment of article processing charges. A 2013 study showed this practice was higher in journals with a scientific or medical focus (43% and 47% respectively), and lowest in journals publishing in the arts and humanities (0% and 4% respectively).&#91;19&#93; Traditionally, many academic journals levied page charges, long before open access became a possibility.&#91;citation needed&#93;\n",
      "There currently is a growing global debate&#91;20&#93;&#91;21&#93;&#91;22&#93;&#91;23&#93;&#91;24&#93; regarding open access's ideology and ethics and its related article processing charges, as they are being created and managed by academic journal and monograph publisher conglomerates together with some national and international academic institutions and government bodies. One controversy is \"double dipping\", where both authors and subscribers are charged.&#91;25&#93; Groups offering open access solutions&#91;clarification needed&#93; include the Publishers for Development and Research4Life projects and activities.\n",

As summarized by Peter Suber:&#91;27&#93; \"Some no-fee OA journals have direct or indirect subsidies from institutions like universities, laboratories, research centers, libraries, hospitals, museums, learned societies, foundations, or government agencies. Some have revenue from a separate line of non-OA publications. Some have revenue from advertising, auxiliary services, membership dues, endowments, reprints, or a print or premium edition.

      "Many publishers permit authors to self-archive in an open access repository, but may place restrictions on which version of the work may be shared and/or require an embargo period following the original date of publication. What is deposited can be either a preprint, or the peer-reviewed postprint – either the author's refereed, revised final draft or the publisher's version of record. Some publishers require delays, or an embargo, on when a research output in a repository may be made open access.&#91;38&#93; To find out if a publisher or journal has given a green light to author self-archiving, the author can check the Publisher Copyright Policies and Self-Archiving list&#91;39&#93; on the SHERPA/RoMEO web site.\n",

      "Motivations[edit]\n",
      "Main article: Academic journal publishing reform\n",
      "Open access itself (mostly green and gratis) began to be sought and provided worldwide by researchers when the possibility itself was opened by the advent of Internet and the World Wide Web. The momentum was further increased by a growing movement for academic journal publishing reform, and with it gold and libre OA. Electronic publishing created new benefits as compared to paper publishing but beyond that, it contributed to causing problems in traditional publishing models.\n",
      "The premises behind open access publishing are that there are viable funding models to maintain traditional peer review standards of quality while also making the following changes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than making journal articles accessible through a subscription business model, all academic publications could be made free to read and published with some other cost-recovery model, such as publication charges, subsidies, or charging subscriptions only for the print edition, with the online edition gratis or \"free to read\".&#91;58&#93;\n",
      "Rather than applying traditional notions of copyright to academic publications, they could be libre or \"free to build upon\".&#91;58&#93;\n",
      "An obvious advantage of open access journals is the free access to scientific papers regardless of affiliation with a subscribing library and improved access for the general public; this is especially true in developing countries. Lower costs for research in academia and industry have been claimed in the Budapest Open Access Initiative,&#91;59&#93; although others have argued that OA may raise the total cost of publication,&#91;60&#93; and further increase economic incentives for exploitation in academic publishing.&#91;61&#93; The open access movement is motivated by the problems of social inequality caused by restricting access to academic research, which favor large and wealthy institutions with the financial means to purchase access to many journals, as well as the economic challenges and perceived unsustainability of academic publishing.&#91;58&#93;&#91;62&#93;\n",
      "\n",
      "Stakeholders and concerned communities[edit]\n",
      "The intended audience of research articles is usually other researchers. Open access helps researchers as readers by opening up access to articles that their libraries do not subscribe to. One of the great beneficiaries of open access may be users in developing countries, where currently some universities find it difficult to pay for subscriptions required to access the most recent journals.&#91;63&#93; Some schemes exist for providing subscription scientific publications to those affiliated to institutions in developing countries at little or no cost.&#91;64&#93; All researchers benefit from open access as no library can afford to subscribe to every scientific journal and most can only afford a small fraction of them – this is known as the \"serials crisis\".&#91;65&#93;\n",
      "Open access extends the reach of research beyond its immediate academic circle. An open access article can be read by anyone – a professional in the field, a researcher in another field, a journalist, a politician or civil servant, or an interested layperson. Indeed, a 2008 study revealed that mental health professionals are roughly twice as likely to read a relevant article if it is freely available.&#91;66&#93;\n",

      "Play media  An interview on paywalls and open access with NIH Director Francis Collins and inventor Jack Andraka\n",
      "The main reason authors make their articles openly accessible is to maximize their research impact.&#91;67&#93; \n",
      "There have been claims of higher citation rates for open access authors.&#91;68&#93; The overall citation rates for a time period of 2 years (2010–2011) were 30% higher for subscription journals, but, after controlling for discipline, journal age and publisher location, the differences largely disappeared in most subcategories, except for those launched prior to 1996.&#91;69&#93; A study in 2001 first reported an open access citation impact advantage,&#91;70&#93;\n",
      "Two major studies dispute the claim that open access articles lead to more citations.&#91;71&#93;&#91;72&#93; A randomized controlled trial of open access publishing involving 36 participating journals in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities found that open access articles (n=712) received significantly more downloads and reached a broader audience within the first year, yet were cited no more frequently, nor earlier, than subscription-access control articles (n=2533) within 3 years.&#91;71&#93;\n",
      "Many other studies, both major and minor and with varying degrees of methodological rigor, find that an open access article is more likely to be used and cited than one behind subscription barriers.&#91;73&#93;\n",
      "For example, a 2006 study in PLoS Biology found that articles published as immediate open access in PNAS were three times more likely to be cited than non-open access papers, and were also cited more than PNAS articles that were only self-archived.&#91;68&#93; This result has been challenged as an artifact of authors self-selectively paying to publish their higher quality articles in hybrid open access journals,&#91;74&#93; whereas a 2010 study found that the open access citation advantage was equally big whether self-archiving was self-selected or mandated.&#91;75&#93;\n",
      "A 2010 study of 27,197 articles in 1,984 journals used institutionally mandated open access instead of randomized open access to control for bias on the part of authors toward self-selectively making their better (hence more citeable) articles open access. The result was a replication of the repeatedly reported open access citation advantage, with the advantage being equal in size and significance whether the open access was self-selected or mandated.&#91;75&#93;\n",
      "A 2016 study reported that the odds of an open access journal being referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47% higher than for paywalled journals, and suggested that this constitutes a significant \"amplifier\" effect for science published on such platforms.&#91;76&#93;\n",
      "Scholars are paid by research funders and/or their universities to do research; the published article is the report of the work they have done, rather than an item for commercial gain. The more the article is used, cited, applied and built upon, the better for research as well as for the researcher's career.&#91;77&#93;&#91;78&#93; Open access can reduce publication delays, an obstacle which led some research fields such as high-energy physics to adopt widespread preprint access.&#91;79&#93;\n",
      "Some professional organizations have encouraged use of open access: in 2001, the International Mathematical Union communicated to its members that \"Open access to the mathematical literature is an important goal\" and encouraged them to \"[make] available electronically as much of our own work as feasible\" to \"[enlarge] the reservoir of freely available primary mathematical material, particularly helping scientists working without adequate library access\".&#91;80&#93;\n",

      "Research funding agencies and universities want to ensure that the research they fund and support in various ways has the greatest possible research impact.&#91;81&#93; As a means of achieving this, research funders are beginning to expect open access to the research they support. Many of them (including all seven UK Research Councils) have already adopted green open access self-archiving mandates, and others are on the way to do so (see ROARMAP).\n",
      "In 2008, the NIH Public Access Policy, an open access mandate was put into law, and required that research papers describing research funded by the National Institutes of Health must be available to the public free through PubMed Central within 12 months of publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Universities[edit]\n",
      "A growing number of universities are providing institutional repositories in which their researchers can deposit their published articles.

      "In May 2005, 16 major Dutch universities cooperatively launched DAREnet, the Digital Academic Repositories, making over 47,000 research papers available to anyone with internet access.&#91;84&#93; From 1 January 2007, at the completion of the DARE programme, KNAW Research Information has taken over responsibility for the DAREnet portal. On 2 June 2008, DAREnet has been incorporated into the scholarly portal NARCIS.&#91;85&#93; At the end of 2009, NARCIS provided access to 185,000 open access publications from all Dutch universities, KNAW, NWO and a number of scientific institutes.\n",

      "Libraries and librarians[edit]\n",
      "As information professionals, librarians are vocal and active advocates of open access. These librarians believe that open access promises to remove both the price barriers and the permission barriers that undermine library efforts to provide access to the scholarly record,&#91;92&#93; as well as helping to address the serials crisis. Many library associations have either signed major open access declarations, or created their own. For example, the Canadian Library Association endorsed a Resolution on Open Access in June 2005.&#91;93&#93;\n",
      "Librarians also lead education and outreach initiatives to faculty, administrators, and others about the benefits of open access. For example, the Association of College and Research Libraries of the American Library Association has developed a Scholarly Communications Toolkit.&#91;94&#93; The Association of Research Libraries has documented the need for increased access to scholarly information, and was a leading founder of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC).&#91;95&#93;&#91;96&#93;\n",
      "At most universities, the library manages the institutional repository, which provides free access to scholarly work by the university's faculty. The Canadian Association of Research Libraries has a program&#91;97&#93; to develop institutional repositories at all Canadian university libraries.\n",
      "An increasing number of libraries provide hosting services for open access journals. A 2008 survey by the Association of Research Libraries&#91;98&#93; found that 65% of surveyed libraries either are involved in journal publishing, or are planning to become involved in the very near future.&#91;99&#93;\n",
      "In 2013, open access activist Aaron Swartz was posthumously awarded the American Library Association's James Madison Award for being an \"outspoken advocate for public participation in government and unrestricted access to peer-reviewed scholarly articles\".&#91;100&#93;&#91;101&#93; In March 2013, the entire editorial board and the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Library Administration resigned en masse, citing a dispute with the journal's publisher.&#91;102&#93; One board member wrote of a \"crisis of conscience about publishing in a journal that was not open access\" after the death of Aaron Swartz.&#91;103&#93;&#91;104&#93;\n",
      "The pioneer of the open access movement in France and one of the first librarians to advocate the self-archiving approach to open access worldwide is Hélène Bosc.&#91;105&#93; Her work is described in her \"15-year retrospective\".&#91;106&#93;\n",
      "\n",
      "Public[edit]\n",
      "Open access to scholarly research is argued to be important to the public for a number of reasons. One of the arguments for public access to the scholarly literature is that most of the research is paid for by taxpayers through government grants, who therefore have a right to access the results of what they have funded. This is one of the primary reasons for the creation of advocacy groups such as The Alliance for Taxpayer Access in the US.&#91;107&#93; Examples of people who might wish to read scholarly literature include individuals with medical conditions (or family members of such individuals) and serious hobbyists or 'amateur' scholars who may be interested in specialized scientific literature (e.g. amateur astronomers). Additionally, professionals in many fields may be interested in continuing education in the research literature of their field, and many businesses and academic institutions cannot afford to purchase articles from or subscriptions to much of the research literature that is published under a toll access model.\n",
      "Even those who do not read scholarly articles benefit indirectly from open access.&#91;108&#93; For example, patients benefit when their doctor and other health care professionals have access to the latest research. As argued by open access advocates, open access speeds research progress, productivity, and knowledge translation.&#91;109&#93; Every researcher in the world can read an article, not just those whose library can afford to subscribe to the particular journal in which it appears. Faster discoveries benefit everyone. High school and junior college students can gain the information literacy skills critical for the knowledge age. Critics of the various open access initiatives claim that there is little evidence that a significant amount of scientific literature is currently unavailable to those who would benefit from it.&#91;110&#93; While no library has subscriptions to every journal that might be of benefit, virtually all published research can be acquired via interlibrary loan.&#91;111&#93; Note that interlibrary loan may take a day or weeks depending on the loaning library and whether they will scan and email, or mail the article. Open access online, by contrast is faster, often immediate, making it more suitable than interlibrary loan for fast-paced research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-income countries[edit]\n",
      "In developing nations, open access archiving and publishing acquires a unique importance. Scientists, health care professionals, and institutions in developing nations often do not have the capital necessary to access scholarly literature, although schemes exist to give them access for little or no cost. Among the most important is HINARI,&#91;112&#93; the Health InterNetwork Access to Research Initiative, sponsored by the World Health Organization. HINARI, however, also has restrictions. For example, individual researchers may not register as users unless their institution has access,&#91;113&#93; and several countries that one might expect to have access do not have access at all (not even \"low-cost\" access) (e.g. South Africa).&#91;113&#93;\n",
      "Many open access projects involve international collaboration. For example, the SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online),&#91;114&#93; is a comprehensive approach to full open access journal publishing, involving a number of Latin American countries. Bioline International, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping publishers in developing countries is a collaboration of people in the UK, Canada, and Brazil; the Bioline International Software is used around the world. Research Papers in Economics (RePEc), is a collaborative effort of over 100 volunteers in 45 countries. The Public Knowledge Project in Canada developed the open-source publishing software Open Journal Systems (OJS), which is now in use around the world, for example by the African Journals Online group, and one of the most active development groups is Portuguese. This international perspective has resulted in advocacy for the development of open-source appropriate technology and the necessary open access to relevant information for sustainable development.&#91;115&#93;&#91;116&#93;\n",
      "\n",
      "Criticism[edit]\n",
      "The main argument against open access, author's paid fee based journals, is the possible damage to the peer review system, diminishing the overall quality of scientific journal publishing. For example, in 2009, a hoax paper generated by a computer program was accepted for publication by a major publisher under the author-pays-for-publication model.&#91;117&#93; In a similar incident, a staff writer for Science magazine and popular science publications targeted the open access system in 2013 by submitting to some such journals a deeply flawed paper on the purported effect of a lichen constituent. About 60% of those journals, including journals published by the major academic publishers Sage Publications and Elsevier the Journal of Natural Pharmaceuticals, accepted the faked medical paper. However, journals published by notable open access publishers PLOS, BioMed Central, and Hindawi Publishing Corporation rejected the fake article. In addition, the faked paper was not published in subscription journals as a control.&#91;118&#93; As a result, this experiment was criticized for using a flawed methodology and not including a control group.&#91;119&#93;&#91;120&#93; Many newer open access journals also lack the reputation of their subscription counterparts, which have been in business for decades. This effect has been diminishing though since 2001, reflecting the emergence of high quality professional open access publishers such as PLOS and BioMed Central.&#91;69&#93;\n",
      "Opponents of the open access model continue to assert that the pay-for-access model is necessary to ensure that the publishers are adequately compensated for their work. Scholarly journal publishers that support pay-for-access claim that the \"gatekeeper\" role they play, maintaining a scholarly reputation, arranging for peer review, and editing and indexing articles, require economic resources that are not supplied under an open access model. Opponents claim that open access is not necessary to ensure fair access for developing nations; differential pricing or financial aid from developed countries or institutions can make access to proprietary journals affordable. Some critics also point out the lack of funding for author fees.&#91;121&#93;\n",

      "Open access literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "There&#8217;s an incredible amount of scientific research conducted at universities and institutions around the world. Historically, the findings of this research have been published in scholarly journals. However, access to this research is typically restricted&#8211;granted only to those who are granted permission via their university affiliation, or by purchasing access to individual articles. This is fundamentally problematic, for many reasons: \n",
      "\n",
      "Governments provide most of the funding for research—hundreds of billions of dollars annually—and public institutions employ a large portion of all researchers.\n",
      "Researchers publish their findings without the expectation of compensation. Unlike other authors, they hand their work over to publishers without payment, in the interest of advancing human knowledge.\n",
      "Through the process of peer review, researchers review each other’s work for free.\n",
      "Once published, those that contributed to the research (from taxpayers to the institutions that supported the research itself) have to pay again to access the findings. Though research is produced as a public good, it isn’t available to the public who paid for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open access publishing is a solution to these problems. Open access literature is defined as &#8220;digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.&#8221; The recommendations of the Budapest Open Access Declaration—including the use of liberal licensing (such as CC BY)— is widely recognized in the community as a means to make a work truly open access.\n",
      "The existing system for producing and distributing publicly funded research articles is expensive and doesn’t take advantage of the possibilities of innovations like open licensing. Without a free-flowing system, access to the results of scientific research is limited to institutions that are able to commit to hefty journal subscriptions — paid for year after year — which don’t allow for broad redistribution, or repurposing for activities such as text and data mining without additional permissions from the rightsholder. This closed system limits the impact on the scientific and scholarly community and progress is slowed significantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "When funding cycles for research include open license requirements for publications, increased access and opportunities for reuse extends the value of research funding. As an example, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy requires the published results of all NIH-funded research to be deposited in PubMed Central’s repository, the peer-reviewed manuscript immediately, and the final journal article within twelve months of publication. Similarly, the directive issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy mandates that federal agencies with more than $100 million in research expenditures must make the results of their research publicly available within one year of publication, and better manage the resultant data supporting their results. These policies utilize aspects of the optimized cycle below, and are a step in the right direction for making better use of public funding for research articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open access policies and practices are being adopted in a variety of different settings. Above and beyond open licensing policies for publicly funded research, philanthropic foundations, NGOs, and intergovernmental organizations are using open licensing to share the research that they&#8211;or their grantees&#8211;are creating. Open access journals are publishing Creative Commons-licensed research, which promotes access and re-use of scientific and scholarly research.\n",

      "The Budapest Declaration by the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) was published in 2002 and marked the beginning of the Open Access movement. The Declaration takes a strong stand on the role of Open Access to information:\n",
      "“An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good. The old tradition is the willingness of scientists and scholars to publish the fruits of their research in scholarly journals without payment, for the sake of inquiry and knowledge. The new technology is the internet. The public good they make possible is the world-wide electronic distribution of the peer-reviewed journal literature and completely free and unrestricted access to it by all scientists, scholars, teachers, students, and other curious minds. Removing access barriers to this literature will accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge.”\n",

The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.”\n",
      "&nbsp;\n",
      "In the past 10 years Open Access has been increasingly used by different publishers with their own definitions. These definitions are in many cases deviating considerably from the original BOAI definition.\n",
      "With the launch of the @ccess Initiative we  want to reclaim the original meaning of Open Access as the one defined by the BOAI.   Because of the erosion of the term Open Access, which now can mean a lot of things,  we want to introduce the use of Budapest compliant Open Access for Immediate , free and unrestricted Open Access as defined by the BOAI.\n",

      "In 2003 two other statements were published on open access publishing. The Bethesda Statement and the Berlin Declaration are both very similar to the Budapest definition. This the reason that these definitions for open access are  often referred to as BBB Open Access. After the original Berlin Congress in 2003, yearly Berlin conferences have been held in different countries of Europe. The first Berlin Conference outside Europe was Berlin8 in Beijing. Berlin9 took place in Washington DC in november 2011. All the Berlin conferences have been focussing on practical implications and strategies for open access. The Berlin4 conference for example focused on open access to raw scientific data in the interest of transparency in scientific research. The material of all Berlin conferences taken together forms a treasure trove for open access related subjects.\n",
      "Creative Commons\n",
      "Many publications are published using the Creative Commons non-commercial variant of licencing (CC-NC) which essentially means that works can be accessed and read freely and nothing more. Reuse and redistribution as mentioned in the BOAI definition are explicitly forbidden. The CC-BY licence is the closest to the BOAI definition. A third variant CC-BY-SA has some more restrictions. The original meaning of Open Access (OA) has become even more clouded by the distinction between Green OA (articles in repositories), Gold OA (articles in journals), gratis OA (reader pays nothing) and libre OA (gratis with one or more barriers lifted). All combinations of these flavours are possible.*\n",
      "Open Data\n",
      "For a definition of Open Data in science we refer to the Panton principles for open data in science, a set of rules for the open access publication of data and data sets. The principles contain a STRONG recommendation that data, especially where publicly funded, be explicitly placed in the public domain via the use of the Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL) or Creative Commons Zero Waiver (CC-0).\n",

      "Does @ccess validate material?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why has @access been started?\n",
      "We believe that modern electronic scholarship depends critically on material that is available to everyone for reading, editing, re-using, textmining, datamining, mashups, republication and similar activities. We define such material as Open Access if it conforms to the definition laid out in the Budapest Open Access Initiative:\n",
      "&#8220;The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.&#8221;\n",
      "Moreover, we believe that the open access movement should not only be an academic pursuit. Thousands of people are cut off from current scientific knowledge by the high fees required to access it. Patient advocates, health care practitioners, small businesses, translators, citizen and amateur scientists among others. They are the &#8216;Scholarly Poor&#8217; and the reason we want @ccess for all.\n",
      "What are BOAI? and OKD and why do they matter?\n",
      "The Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) originated at a meeting in Budapest on December 1-2, 2001, organised by Open Society Institute (OSI), which aimed to accelerate progress in the international effort to make research articles in all academic fields freely available on the internet. In the words of the BOAI:\n",
      "By &#8220;open access&#8221; to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.\n",
      "The Open Knowledge Definition sets out principles to define ‘openness’ in relation to content and data – that’s any kind of material or data ‘from sonnets to statistics, genes to geodata’. The definition can be summed up in the statement that “A piece of content or data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share-alike.”\n",
      "While OKD has a scope beyond the scholarly literature, there are few differences between the two statements other than the OKD allows a requirement to share alike whereas the BOAI does not; in terms of licensing BOAI defines &#8220;Open Access&#8221; content as under a CC-BY Attribution or more permissive license.\n",
      "This is important because scholarly literature currently labelled as &#8216;Open Access&#8217; is not always BOAI compliant, it may have non-commercial clauses, modification may be banned or permissions may be unclear. @ccess is reclaiming the BOAI definition of Open Access.\n",
      "Can anyone join @ccess?\n",
      "Yes! There is no barrier to membership, anyone who joins our mailing list and is actively participating in group activities is considered a member and can request to be listed on the members page of the website.\n",
      "Is @ccess only about science and medicine?\n",
      "Absolutely not. It&#8217;s about Open Scholarship in its most general sense. This extends to Arts and Humanities, Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM), the entire body of scholarly knowledge. This applies wherever knowledge is Open or people feel it should be Open.\n",
      "Aren&#8217;t there already groups working on Open Access?\n",
      "Yes, many groups are working to promote open access from multiple perspectives, a selection of such organisations are listed here: OAD List\n",
      "Is @ccess just about Open Access to published scholarly literature?\n",
      "A fundamental aspect of @ccess is that anyone can be part of it. You don&#8217;t have to be an employed academic. Citizen Science and Wikipedia have shown that anyone can help to build top quality scholarly material. It&#8217;s possible that @ccess might create its own Open publications &#8211; they will possibly look different from current &#8220;journals&#8221;.\n",
      "What are your views of the legal aspects of copyright?\n",
      "We work within existing laws &#8211; it is not a &#8220;pirate&#8221; organization. However we believe that many copyright laws and practices are seriously detrimental to scholarship and the human, physical and intellectual health of the planet. It will work to get them changed, in part by showing the values of Open material.\n",
      "How do you carry out its business?\n",
      "Openly. Wherever possible discussions will be conducted in public on the open-access mailing list, which is fully archived. Meetings will be conducted via Skype with relevant minutes being recorded on public Etherpads.\n",
      "Are you a legal entity?\n",
      "@ccess is a working group under the umbrella of the Open Knowledge Foundation Network. Members are volunteers and the initiative itself is not a legal entity.\n",
      "The Open Knowledge Foundation Limited is a not-for-profit organization, incorporated in England &amp; Wales as a company limited by guarantee with company number 05133759.\n",
      "How do I find out more about @ccess?\n",
      "You can join our mailing list and catch up on previous discussions in the archives. Project updates on work in progress may also be posted on the @ccess wiki before it is ready to appear on this site.\n",
      "How do you pronounce @ccess?\n",
      "Ak-ses\n",
      "What is @ccess currently doing?\n",
      "We are currently developing ideas on the road to follow towards the goal of  @ccess for everyone to all scientific publications . Although we have started as a relatively small group we have the ambition to grow into a large group of  networked communities of scientists and non-scientists sharing community generated knowledge. For this we have explicitly opted for a bottom-up structure, driven by the community.  We do not want to fall into the trap of becoming an inert and ineffective hierarchical structured organisation.\n",
      "&nbsp;\n",
      "How does @access differ from Open Access? \n",
      "Open Access has taken on different meanings after the original definition by the Budapest Open Access Initiative BOAI) in 2002. With the introduction of the term @ccess for BOAI compliant Open Access, we want to create an unique identifier for Open Access according to the BOAI definition.\n",
      "Does @ccess validate material?\n",
      "For the moment @ccess does not validate or certify scientific publications. We will engage in discussions with SPARC to see if there is a need to do so in the near future.\n",

      "Open access as discussed in relation to this policy refers to free availability of journal articles on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful, noncommercial purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.\n",
      "The definition of the concept emerged from three conferences:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do researchers support open access?\n",
      "\n",
      "Many OA advocates support this unrestricted access because they believe the results of tax-payer funded research should be shared; since citizens have paid for this research, they should be able to access it at no additional charge.\n",
      "Many OA advocates also support unrestricted access because knowledge itself, or information, is a public good. A public good is something beneficial to everyone who seeks it, without added use diminishing its value.Common examples of public goods include: law enforcement, lighthouses, clean air and other environmental goods, and information goods, such as software development, authorship, and invention.\n",
      "Open access has been driven by several forces:\n",
      "The web offers new methods of publication: it makes distribution of research easier, wider, faster, and frequently less expensive.\n",
      "The web offers new outlets and methods for sharing and using research and for supporting teaching, creating demand for an access model that allows faculty and universities to take full advantage of these new outlets and methods (e.g. in settings like MIT’s OpenCourseWare) or in institutional or discipline-based repositories for research (e.g. DSpace@MIT, or the archive for physics and related fields, ArXiv.)\n",
      "Some supporters believe that open access will address entrenched problems with high prices and strict use and purchase terms faced by universities buying traditional journals in digital form.\n",
      "&nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why would an author pursue open access for their publications?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most academic authors are interested in creating as wide a readership as possible; open access extends readership.\n",
      "Most academic authors are interested in their research having as big an impact as possible; research shows that open access to articles improves citation rates. There are also studies specific to book publishing that show similar things.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How do the economics of open access work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Open access to research and scholarship is not free—there are costs involved in making research available. The economic models to support unrestricted access to research are still being developed; the common thread among the models is that open access research is available at no charge to all readers.\n",
      "One model that exists is for there to be a payment when the author submits an article. Usually this charge to publish an open access article is covered by research grant funds. In 2004, one study by Elsevier found that this “author side” payment model encompassed just 17% of open access journals. In an updated study in 2007, Bill Hooker did a survey of all known open access journals and found that only 18% charged fees. The open access publisher BioMed Central offers a table comparing such author side payments.\n",
      "Other economic models are also being experimented with. For example, some new open access publishers, such as the for-profit BioMed Central, require author payments, but these are waived for institutions who’ve purchased a membership, as the MIT Libraries have for MIT. In other cases, such as the not-for-profit PLoS (Public Library of Science), the MIT Libraries’ institutional membership reduces the publication fee for MIT faculty and researchers.\n",
      "Other titles are subsidized, often by scholarly societies, institutions, or foundations. The 2004 Elsevier study found that government or university subsidies accounted for 55% of the total open access titles, the largest portion. The remaining open access titles (28%) that were not supported by ‘author side’ payments, or by government or universities, were found to be subsidized by paid subscriptions to their print equivalents.\n",
      "Some journals are entirely open access; every article is available without restriction. Other journals are ‘hybrid’ in that they are traditional subscription-based journals, but offer authors the choice to pay a fee to make their individual article freely accessible to anyone worldwide. The other articles in the journal remain accessible only through subscription.\n",
      "Some publishers offer all their titles under one kind of open access policy, and others have different policies for different titles. In 2006, the MIT Press launched its first entirely open access journal, Information Technologies and International Development.\n",

      "\n",
      "What is the goal of the policy?\n",
      "The goal is expressed in the first line of the policy: “The Faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is committed to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is MIT’s policy unique?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Law School, the Stanford School of Education, among many others, have similar policies. See a list of universities in the US that have policies and a complete world-wide list of various kinds of open access policies.\n",
      "Research funders are supporting such efforts as well. For instance, the National Institutes of Health was one of the first federal funders to require posting of articles derived from research they fund in an open-access repository. See more information on research funder policies here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What does the policy do for me?\n",
      "The web makes it possible for faculty to share their articles widely, openly, and freely; in addition, research has repeatedly shown that articles available freely online are more often cited and have greater impact than those not freely available. While many faculty already make their writings available on their web pages, some are prevented from doing so by perceived or actual limits set on such sharing in their publisher copyright transfer agreements. This policy will allow you to legally make your writings openly accessible, and it will enable MIT to help you do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complying with the policy\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I comply with the policy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The policy operates automatically to give MIT a license in any scholarly articles faculty members complete after its adoption.\n",
      "To be thorough, MIT recommends that you communicate this policy to your publisher and add to any copyright license or assignment for scholarly articles an addendum stating that the agreement is subject to this prior license. That way, you will avoid agreeing to give the publisher rights that are inconsistent with the prior license to MIT that permits open-access distribution. MIT provides a suitable form of addendum for this purpose. Whether you use the addendum or not, the license to MIT still will have force.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What if a journal publisher refuses to publish my article because of the prior permission given to MIT under the policy?\n",
      "You have a number of options. One is to try to persuade the publisher that it should accept MIT’s non-exclusive license in order to be able to publish your article. Another is to seek a different publisher. A third is to consult with the our office (scholarlypub@mit.edu) or the Office of General Counsel about taking steps to address the publisher’s specific concerns. A fourth is to obtain a waiver for the article under the policy (see more below under Opting Out.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When and where do I submit a paper to DSpace@MIT under the policy?\n",
      "Papers should be submitted as of the date of publication. To submit a paper under the policy, upload the author’s final manuscript, post peer-review, via a web form, or send it to the OA Policy Submission email list. If you have already submitted this version to a preprint server (e.g. arXiv), you may email the paper’s identifying repository number, or the URL, instead of the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scope of the policy\n",
      "\n",
      "What kinds of writings does this apply to?\n",
      "\n",
      "It applies to “scholarly articles.” Using terms from the Budapest Open Access Initiative, scholarly articles are articles that describe the fruits of research and that authors give to the world for the sake of inquiry and knowledge without expectation of payment. Such articles are typically presented in peer-reviewed scholarly journals and conference proceedings.\n",
      "Many written products are not encompassed under this specific notion of scholarly article, such as books, popular articles, commissioned articles, fiction and poetry, encyclopedia entries, ephemeral writings, lecture notes, lecture videos, or other copyrighted works. The Open Access Policy is not meant to address these kinds of works.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What version of the paper is submitted under the policy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The author’s final version of the article; that is, the author’s manuscript with any changes made as a result of the peer-review process, but prior to publisher’s copy-editing or formatting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Does the policy apply to articles I’ve already written?\n",
      "The policy doesn’t apply to articles that were completed before the policy was adopted March 18, 2009, nor to any articles for which you entered into an incompatible publishing agreement before the policy was adopted. The policy also does not apply to any articles you write after leaving MIT.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Does the policy apply to co-authored papers?\n",
      "Yes. Each joint author of an article holds copyright in the article and, individually, has the authority to grant MIT a non-exclusive license. Joint authors are those who participate in the preparation of the article with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why aren’t images covered by the policy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Images are created by faculty in such a wide range of contexts and for such a wide range of purposes that it was too complex to include images in the policy. To the extent that images are contained in the articles, however, they would be covered by the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Why aren’t Ph.D. theses included in the policy?\n",
      "MIT has already made a commitment to making Ph.D. theses openly available worldwide. DSpace@MIT makes more than 40,000 selected theses and dissertations from all MIT departments, dating as far back as the mid 1800′s, openly available to the world. Since 2004, all new Masters and Ph.D. theses are being scanned and added to this collection after degrees are awarded. Regardless of whether copyright is held by the student or the Institute, the MIT Libraries publish the thesis electronically, allowing open access viewing. While there are fees charged for scanning and printing theses, these fees are used to scan more theses and make them available for open viewing. Without these fees, only a very small subset of theses (those submitted electronically) would be available online. While the current system is not strictly open access as defined by the Budapest Open Access Initiative, which would include no limits on printing, it’s a significant step in that direction.\n",

Another was the desire to comply with a certain society’s policies even if in conflict with this policy.\n",

You can exercise your copyrights in any way you see fit, including transferring them to a publisher if you so desire. However, if you do so, MIT would still retain its license and the right to distribute the article from its repository. Also, if your article arises in whole or in part from federally funded research, you may have to retain sufficient rights to comply with public access policies.\n",

      "How can I use an article that appears with both a publisher copyright statement and a Creative Commons License?\n",
      "\n",
      "Some articles in the MIT Open Access Articles collection appear with a publisher’s copyright statement (e.g. “c2009 American Physical Society”) in addition to a Creative Commons license. The publisher’s copyright statement may indicate that the article’s copyright was transferred by the author(s) to the publisher, or that the author used a template provided by the publisher in expectation of copyright being transferred. Because the MIT Open Access Policy operates automatically to give MIT a license to any scholarly articles faculty members complete after its adoption, MIT’s license predates this transfer of copyright to a publisher. Therefore, while the article’s copyright is held by the publisher, that copyright is subject to MIT’s pre-existing license.\n",
      "MIT has chosen to distribute articles under its Open Access Policy using one of the standard Creative Commons licenses: the Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license. If a CC license appears with an article, it is the CC license that determines how the article may be used.\n",
      "This particular CC license means that you are free to share (copy, distribute and transmit the work) and remix (adapt) the work under the following conditions:\n",
      "• Attribution: You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggest that they endorse you or your use of the work)\n",
      "• Noncommercial: You may not use this work for commercial purposes\n",

      "\n",
      "What happens with articles that fall under the policy\n",
      "\n",
      "What will MIT do with the articles?\n",
      "MIT will continue to operate its open-access repository, DSpace@MIT, to make available the scholarly articles provided under the policy. This repository has MIT standing behind it to ensure its availability, longevity, and functionality, to the extent technologically feasible. The repository is backed up, mirrored, and made open to harvesting by search services such as OAIster and Google Scholar. Adjustments will be made to the deposit processes, under the guidance of the Faculty Committee on the Library System, to make it as convenient as possible. MIT may further allow others to distribute the content, provided that the articles are not sold for profit. For instance, faculty at other institutions could be given permission to make copies for free distribution directly to their students. However, MIT does not have– and cannot grant to others –the right to sell the articles for a profit or to sell a book containing the articles for a profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Does this license preclude all activities that involve payment?\n",
      "No, not necessarily. An activity will not cease to be permitted under the policy merely because a charge is imposed to cover some or all of the costs of the activity, provided that articles are not sold for a profit. Hence, for example, MIT’s selling course packs at cost would be permitted. The Faculty Committee on the Library System will provide advice on what licensed uses of repository material are appropriate and consistent with the purposes of the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can others distribute my work, for instance, placing it in a course pack?\n",
      "This policy would grant MIT the right to license others to distribute the work, so long as the work was not sold for a profit. For example, MIT could give permission for an article to be used in a course pack (including giving such permission to you if you have otherwise transferred copyright), so long as the course pack was not sold for profit. No one would be able to sell your articles for profit without getting permission from the appropriate rights holder, whether that were you or a publisher to whom you have assigned such rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Can my articles be used to provide search or other services by companies such as Google?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the license allows MIT to enable both commercial and nonprofit entities to use the articles to provide search or other services, so long as the articles are not being sold for a profit. This is true even if the services generate advertising revenues or the company charges for the services. For instance, the license allows MIT to enable the articles to be harvested and indexed by search services, such as Google Scholar, so that they can more readily be found, and to be used to provide other value-added services as long as the articles themselves are not sold for a profit. MIT also could authorize use of the articles in a commercial service that provides information extracted from the articles (but not the full text itself), such as bibliographic data or citation lists. Any arrangements would be consistent with the goals of open access and ensuring wide visibility and availability of scholarly articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Who will monitor implementation of the policy?\n",
      "The Faculty Committee on the Library System (which is a standing committee of the MIT faculty) is working with the MIT Libraries to develop an implementation plan that has faculty interests in mind. They anticipate developing processes and procedures by soliciting input from the faculty and providing progress reports to the faculty as the implementation plan is developed. The Faculty Policy Committee will be responsible for presenting a report regarding the policy to the faculty in five years.\n",

      "How the OA policy affects scholarly publishing\n",
      "\n",
      "Will this policy harm journals, scholarly societies, small friendly publishers, or peer review?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no empirical evidence that even when all articles are freely available, journals are canceled. The major societies in physics have not seen any impact on their publishing programs despite the fact that for many years an open access repository (arXiv) has been making available nearly all of the High Energy Physics literature written during that period. If there is downward pressure on journal prices over time, publishers with the most inflated prices – which tend to be the commercial publishers – will feel the effects sooner. Journals will still be needed for their value-added services, such as peer review logistics, copy editing, type setting, and maintaining web sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Will this policy harm those in tenure processes who need to show publication in high quality journals?\n",
      "The opt out option protects authors who need to publish in journals that will not cooperate with the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How will this policy affect other universities, particularly small ones?\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect that as similar policies are passed at more universities, the overall climate for scholarly communication will improve, to the benefit of all institutions of higher education. Smaller universities may not have the resources to build their own repositories, but shared repositories are starting to become available for such cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s in it for MIT?\n",
      "\n",
      "The policy would increase the impact of MIT research by making it more widely available. Studies show a very large citation advantage for open access articles, ranging from 45% to over 500%, but restrictive publisher business models limit wide sharing through onerous terms in contracts with university libraries and individual authors. For example, many publishers prohibit authors from posting their work openly on the web, and publishers commonly ‘rent’ access to their content, putting access at risk following cancellation of subscriptions. Performing systematic searching, advanced indexing, or analysis are prohibited in virtually all contracts.\n",
      "The policy would give MIT a means of negotiating for more attractive terms with publishers, an effort needed in a context of dramatic inflation and market consolidation: the 5 largest journal publishers now account for over half of total market revenues, and over the past 15 years, the price of scholarly journals has grown roughly three times as fast as the Consumer Price Index.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "More information on the policy\n",
      "\n",
      "How is granting a nonexclusive license to MIT compatible with MIT being able to exercise ‘all rights under copyright’?\n",
      "\n",
      "The legal framework for copyright is that you can’t give away what you don’t have. MIT will have been granted nonexclusive rights, and will not be able in turn to grant exclusive rights. MIT, however, will be able to exercise all of the other rights under copyright, including reproducing, displaying, distributing, and making derivative works of articles covered by the policy, as long as these activities are not done for profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why make this an automatic license? Why not just suggest that faculty individually retain a license for open-access distribution?\n",
      "\n",
      "Experience has shown that “opt in” systems have little effect on authors’ behavior. For instance, before Congress made it a requirement, participation in the NIH Public Access Policy was optional. During that period, there was only a 4% level of compliance. Experience in many areas has shown that opt-out systems achieve much higher degrees of participation than opt-in systems.\n",
      "Individual faculty benefit from a blanket policy because it makes it possible for MIT to work with publishers on behalf of the faculty, to simplify procedures and broaden access.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why isn’t student work, or that of research staff, covered by the policy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2009 policy applies only to faculty because in a faculty policy it seemed clearest to focus on faculty work. (MIT already receives a license to Ph.D. theses; in addition, many student articles will be co-authored by faculty and will be subject to this policy.)\n",
      "As of April 2017, all MIT authors, including students, postdocs, and staff, can “opt-in” to an open access license.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Who will pay for this?\n",
      "\n",
      "MIT already has the technical infrastructure in place to store the articles, in the form of the open access repository DSpace@MIT. In addition, the MIT Libraries have experience supporting access to faculty research such as technical reports and working papers, and for the past several years have maintained an Office of Scholarly Publishing, Copyright, and Licensing to assist faculty who wish to retain rights in their published works. Once an implementation plan is developed, it will be possible to assess what other staff or technical support might be needed, if any, and to reassess priorities in light of those needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How is this policy related to the NIH Public Access Policy, and how is that policy working?\n",
      "\n",
      "The NIH Public Access Policy applies only to NIH funded research – about 1/3 of MIT’s funded research dollars. It requires authors to deposit their peer-reviewed articles in the open access repository PubMedCentral where they must be accessible within 12 months of publication. Making the policy mandatory has had a dramatic effect on deposits: the rate has increased from under 10% to an estimated 60%. The policy makes tax payer funded research available to taxpayers.\n",
      "A particular article could be subject to both this policy and the NIH Public Access Policy, if it is peer reviewed and arose, in whole or in part, from NIH-funded research. If an NIH-funded article is covered by this open access policy, the author would use the MIT amendment to publication agreements to cover NIH’s obligations and accommodate the MIT policy. Even if the author decides to opt out of the policy for an article, the author must reserve rights sufficient to comply with the NIH policy when entering into a publication agreement for the article.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why doesn’t the policy express support for open access journals?\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy takes only a first step towards re-balancing the scholarly publishing system, giving MIT a means of negotiating for faculty and allowing wider sharing of their research. Other steps will no doubt make sense in the future. MIT,  for example, supports open access journals with a fund authors can use for publication fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why doesn’t the policy offer a delay before posting the articles, so that the MIT version doesn’t show until after journal publication?\n",
      "Different disciplines have very different “half lives” for journal articles, making it very difficult to include a particular time period in an overall policy. Instead, the opt out exists for authors whose publishers require a delay before posting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Won’t this lead to the proliferation of versions and confusion over citation?\n",
      "\n",
      "With or without this policy, the academic community will need to work on the problem of version control in digital scholarship. There are technical and standard-based solutions that will address this problem. Some of those examining this issue include an International working group of scholars, scholarly societies, and publishers and the AAAS, among others. Nomenclature and modeling efforts have been begun by the National Information Standards Organization and the Version Identification Framework. These efforts will be closely monitored.\n",
