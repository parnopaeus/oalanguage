</p>
<p>Open Access is a publication model whereby a manuscript is made freely available in some format, in some cases with liberal permission for reuse and redistribution. There is a common distinction between two models of Open Access: Green and Gold. Green Open Access enables the accepted manuscript to be made freely available via an online repository period following an embargo period (also referred to as self-archiving). Gold Open Access enables the version of record to be made freely available on publication with additional usage rights. All journal articles are published under a Green Open Access model by default, whilst the choice of Gold Open Access is made available to authors upon acceptance, usually in return for the payment of an Article Processing Charge (APC).
</p>
<p><strong>2. How do I make my article Open Access?</strong>
</p>
<p>Upon acceptance of your article for publication in the journal you will receive an email in which you will be provided with the option to proceed under the default Green Open Access publishing model or to publish your article under the Gold Open Access model, which will require payment of the APC.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Can I convert articles that I have already published in the journal under the subscription model to Open Access?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, this option is available to you. If you would like to make articles that you have already published in the journal Open Access then please contact the Editorial office.
</p>
<p><strong>4. Are Open Access articles treated differently from those submitted under the subscription model during the submission process?</strong>
</p>
<p>No. All manuscripts will be peer reviewed and processed to the same high standard. Only after acceptance will you be given the option to express your wish to publish Open Access. Publishing your manuscript under Open Access terms will not affect the outcome of the peer review process.
</p>
<p><strong>5. How will readers know that articles are available via Open Access?</strong>
</p>
<p>Each Open Access article is clearly labelled with an Open Access symbol in the online table of contents for each issue of the journal. On the journal website readers can also navigate to a list of Open Access articles.
</p>
<p><strong>6. If I publish under Green Open Access what is the embargo period?</strong>
</p>
<p>The embargo period for all CUP STM journals is 6 months. This is the period from the publication of an article until the accepted manuscript may be made available through a public repository. There is no embargo period for HSS STM journals. For further information please see our <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/open-access-journals/green-open-access-policy-for-journals">Green open access policy for journals.</a>
</p>
<p><strong>7. In which kind of repository am I permitted to deposit my work and which version of the manuscript should I deposit?</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>8. What is the Article Processing Charge (APC)?</strong>
</p>
<p>The APC is the fee that an author needs to pay in order for their article to be published under the <a href="http://core-cms.prod.aop.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/open-access-journals/gold-open-access-journals" target="_blank">gold open access model</a> in the journal. This fee covers costs such as copyediting, typesetting and online hosting. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-file-manager/file/5783738dbd8dfd4e3283c3f2/Cambridge_Journals_APC_price_list.3.5.2.xls" target="_blank">Download our full list of APC charges</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9. How do I pay the APC?</strong>
</p>
<p>Once you have indicated that you would like your article to be published under the gold Open Access model you will be contacted by CCC-RightsLink who are acting on our behalf to collect the APC. Please follow their instructions in order to avoid any delay in the publication of your article.
</p>
<p><strong>11. If I pay the APC when will my article become freely available?</strong>
</p>
<p>The version of record (the final PDF version of the manuscript) will become freely available as soon as it is published online.
</p><p><strong>12. Can my APC be refunded?<br></strong></p><p>We do refund APCs if we have not met our promises to you. See our <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/open-access-journals/gold-open-access-journals">APC refund policy</a> for more information about this and how to request a refund.
</p><p><strong>13. If I pay the APC which version of my article will be made freely available?</strong>
</p>
<p>The version of record will become freely available.
</p>
