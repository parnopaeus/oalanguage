				<h2>What are Article Processing Charges?</h2><p>Like other Open Access publishers, Hindawi charges an Article Processing Charge once an article is accepted for publication. These charges cover the costs of turning a manuscript into a finished article. Hindawi is committed to making the costs of publishing as clear as possible. The charges for each journal are clearly displayed on the journal’s home page.</p><p>You can find a full list of Hindawi’s charges on our <a href="/apc/">APCs page.</a></p><p>When a manuscript is submitted, it passes through the many different departments at Hindawi:</p><ul><li>The Editorial Screening team, who perform initial technical and ethical checks.</li><li>The Editorial team, who help the journal's Academic Editors manage the review process.</li><li>The Production team, who convert the manuscript to a professionally typeset article and well-structured XML.</li><li>The Proofing team, who coordinate the proofing process through Hindawi's Online Proofing System (OPS).</li><li>The Editorial Quality Assurance team, who perform a final check to ensure that the manuscript and its review process adhere to the journal's guidelines and policies.</li><li>Our marketing and communications teams, who ensure your article receives the attention it deserves. </li><li>The technology team, who build and maintain our systems.</li></ul><p>The actual amount payable as an APC varies depending on the journal in which you wish to publish your article.
